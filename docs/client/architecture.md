# Architecture

## The Base Class and Its Hosts

`src/index.js` exports the base class `Omega` (by name and as the default export) and no instance. Each browser framework subclasses it and exports the ONE instance a consumer uses:

| Host | The instance |
|---|---|
| @omega.js/web | `@omega.js/web/runtime` (adds `appearance`, `shell`, `motion`, `exitPopup`) |
| @omega.js/extension | `@omega.js/extension/{popup,sidepanel,options,page}` (one subclass with a context name) |
| @omega.js/desktop | `@omega.js/desktop/renderer` (adds `desktop`, the preload's bridge to main) |

```javascript
// A web page module: the host hands the instance in
export default async ({ omega, options }) => {
  omega.auth.listen({ once: true }, ({ user }) => { /* ... */ });
  omega.utilities.escapeHTML(untrustedText);
  omega.config.environment; // 'development' | 'testing' | 'production'
};
```

**A consumer never writes `new`**: the host builds the instance, `initialize(configuration)` returns it, and `omega.ready` is the same promise. Every module is a plain property the constructor builds (`omega.auth`, never `omega.auth()`), and each module that needs the instance receives it in its constructor (`new Auth(omega)`), so no module imports a singleton.

## Firebase Initialization

`initialize(config)` boots Firebase only when a usable web SDK config resolves:

- `_resolveFirebaseConfig()` checks `cloud.config` first (the omega.json5 role shape — desktop passes its resolved config through), then the nested `firebase.app.config` (the web/extension bridge contract shape). A blob only counts when **at least one value is non-empty** — framework config merges (e.g. UJM's Jekyll chain) inject all-empty-string blobs into Firebase-less sites, and those resolve to `null` (no init, no URL derivation).
- Initialization additionally requires a **non-empty `apiKey`** — the SDK cannot boot without one (it crashes the page with `auth/invalid-api-key`). Configs carrying only `projectId` still resolve so `getFunctionsUrl()` can derive its URL (`getApiUrl()` derives from `brand.url`, not the Firebase blob), but Firebase itself stays uninitialized and the console logs `[Firebase] Skipped: config has no apiKey ...` (same idiom as `[Analytics] Skipped:`).

### What boot loads, and what waits for first use

`_initializeFirebase()` imports and creates the Firebase **app and auth only** (plus App Check when it is on); the auth emulator connects there on a local stack. Firestore and messaging load on first use, each through ONE memoized loader on the instance:

| Loader | Resolves | Readers |
|---|---|---|
| `omega.loadFirebaseFirestore()` | the one Firestore instance. On a local stack the Firestore emulator is connected inside the loader, before the instance reaches any reader. | the account read after sign-in (`auth.js`), the `omega.firestore` wrapper, @omega.js/web's admin pages |
| `omega.loadFirebaseMessaging()` | the one Messaging instance, or `null` where the browser has no service worker or Push API | `notifications.js` (subscribe, unsubscribe, token, foreground messages) |

- Both import their SDK, create the instance and resolve the same promise to every caller, so two callers at once share one import and one instance. The loaders live in `src/modules/firebase-services.js`; the memo is the instance's.
- "Firebase is configured" means `omega.firebaseApp` exists, and every caller gates on it first: a loader called on a page with no Firebase app rejects by name. A signed-out visitor on a page with no Firestore reader never downloads the Firestore SDK.
- `notifications.isSupported()` stays synchronous: the browser's own support (Notification, service worker, Push API) and a configured Firebase, never the messaging SDK.
- The `firebaseFirestore` and `firebaseMessaging` getters are gone; [breaking-changes.md](../shared/breaking-changes.md) has the step.

## Sentry Initialization

`initialize()` never waits on the Sentry SDK: with Sentry on, `omega.sentry.schedule()` installs the early-error buffer at once and loads `@sentry/browser` once the page has settled (`dom.js`'s `whenSettled`). The SDK replays the buffer when it lands, so each early error is captured once; with Sentry off there is no buffer and no SDK import. The contract: [docs/shared/monitoring.md § When Sentry starts](../shared/monitoring.md#when-sentry-starts).
