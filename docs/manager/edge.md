# The edge service — the brand's Cloudflare zone

The `edge` service reconciles the brand's zone to `edge.providers.cloudflare` in
`config/omega.json5`: the zone itself, DNS records, email routing, zone settings, the five
rulesets, scheduled speed tests, and workers. It runs early — third in the walk — because
every DNS-dependent service after it needs the zone to exist. Every handler follows
read → diff → write (Cloudflare requires fetching current state before patching), and each
read step is cached to `.omega/cache/cloudflare/{op}.json` as a debugging aid.

## What it reconciles

| Operation | What it does |
|---|---|
| `zone` | The zone exists; created when missing. A pending zone reports its nameservers, and an interactive run on a manual registrar opens the registrar's nameserver page and polls until the zone activates. The resolved id lands in `edge.providers.cloudflare.zone` ([#434](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/434)) — the id `omega purge` targets from a build, where no Cloudflare token is in play — and rides the run as state for every later operation. |
| `dns-records` | The required platform record set (GitHub Pages, `www`, the email provider's MX/SPF, DMARC; BIMI and the SendGrid CNAMEs only when configured) plus `dns.records` custom entries, diff-synced: create, update, delete. |
| `email-routing` | Cloudflare Email Routing, only when `domain.email.providers` names cloudflare; rules come from `domain.email.forwarding` (`[{ from: 'support' \| '*', to: 'inbox@…' }]`). |
| `zone-settings` | A flat map matching Cloudflare's own setting IDs, diffed in one bulk read and patched per changed setting (Cloudflare has no bulk PATCH). Addon settings (`speed_brain`, `fonts`) need their own GET each. Read-only and absent settings are skipped, and one setting's failure never blocks the rest. |
| `cache-rules` | The `http_request_cache_settings` entrypoint ruleset, rules matched by description. The framework ships the whole default set (below), so a brand that declares nothing still gets both cache lifetimes. |
| `rules-managed-transforms` | Cloudflare's managed request/response headers, enabled or disabled per config name, PATCHed in one call. |
| `rules-redirect` | The `http_request_dynamic_redirect` ruleset — the ONE home for a brand's templated redirects ([#466](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/466), below). |
| `rules-configuration` | The `http_config_settings` ruleset. |
| `rules-response-headers` | The `http_response_headers_transform` ruleset (always PUT — at the ruleset's id when it exists, at the phase entrypoint when it does not). |
| `rules-security` | Custom firewall rules in `http_request_firewall_custom`. |
| `speed-scheduled-tests` | The homepage's Speed Test schedule (a create-or-replace POST on the custom Speed API endpoint). |
| `workers` | Worker scripts + routes from `edge.providers.cloudflare.workers` — `script` names a file in the service's own `workers/` dir, `route` supports `{ domain }` templating. Unconfigured workers and routes are removed. |

## Config

Everything sits under `edge.providers.cloudflare`:

- `enabled: false` — the tri-state opt-out; the whole service skips.
- `zone` — the resolved zone id, written back by the `zone` operation.
- `dns` — `spf` (`'strict'`/`'soft'`), `dmarcPolicy`, `spfIncludes`, `dmarcReports.{rua,ruf}`,
  `bimiLogo`, and `records[]` for custom entries such as verification TXTs. The SendGrid
  domain-auth values are NOT here — they are read live off SendGrid every run
  ([#692](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/692), below).
- `settings` — the zone-settings map, keyed by Cloudflare's setting IDs exactly.
- `cacheRules[]`, `rules.{managedTransforms,redirect,configuration,responseHeaders,security}`,
  `speedTest.{frequency,region}`, `workers[]`.

The manager's defaults hold PLATFORM answers only; company-specific values (DMARC report
addresses, the BIMI logo, extra CSP hosts) belong in the company or brand layer.

**Credential**: `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN` in the brand `.env`, asked for through the shared setup
contract. No `brand.url` → the service skips.

## Cache lifetimes: /assets for a year, HTML for a minute

The manager's defaults carry the whole `cacheRules` set, so a brand that declares no rules
still reconciles both of them ([#751](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/751)):

| Rule | Matches | Edge TTL | Browser TTL |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Assets: Cache for 1 Year` | `/assets/*` plus `/__/auth/iframe.js`, on any host | 1 year | 1 year |
| `HTML: Short Browser Cache` | a SITE host (not `api.`), outside `/assets`, with no file extension or ending `.html` | 2 hours | 1 minute |

The safety in the one-year rule is the CONTENT HASH, and only the CSS and JS bundles carry
one (`main-39ce99d8.css`, `first-paint-A7T6PAIK.js`): new bytes get a new URL, so the old
one can be held forever. **Fonts and images under `/assets` are NOT hashed** — they land at
stable names by design (`assets/fonts/inter-normal-latin.woff2`,
`assets/images/brand/brandmark-640px.webp`), because `@font-face` src URLs are written into
theme CSS. So replacing a font file or a logo in place pins the OLD file in visitors'
browsers for up to a year, and a purge cannot reach a browser copy: ship such a replacement
under a new filename, or accept the year.

HTML is the opposite of a hashed bundle: its URL never changes, so whatever a browser holds
IS what a returning visitor sees until it expires. One minute is short enough that a deploy
is visible almost immediately; the rule sets its own 2-hour edge TTL (a cache rule overrides
the zone's `edge_cache_ttl` setting) and a deploy purges it.

**A cache rule is ZONE-scoped, so the HTML rule is guarded by host.** The zone serves the
brand's site AND `api.<domain>`, whose Firebase rewrites answer extensionless, user-scoped
GETs (`/authorize`, `/token`, `/omega/**`, `/mcp/**`) — edge-caching one of those would hand
one user's answer to the next. The zone also serves `emailurl.<domain>`, the proxied SendGrid
link-tracking CNAME, whose extensionless click and open URLs must reach SendGrid on every hit or
campaign counts undercount. The guard is `not starts_with(http.host, "api.")` plus the same for
`emailurl.`, rather than an equality on the site host, because every OTHER host on the zone is
a site host: the apex, `www`, and a subdomain project served under the parent zone. Those two
are the non-site hosts the stack creates, at every shape it builds (`api.brand.com`,
`api.app.brand.com` — `packages/manager/src/services/cloud/ensure/hosting.js`;
`emailurl.<domain>` — `packages/manager/src/services/edge/lib/dns-records-helpers.js`). A
hand-added `dns.records` host for some other service is not covered; declare your own
`cacheRules` in that case. The assets rule needs no guard: both of its paths are static files
wherever they are served from.

The two rules cannot both match one request — the HTML expression excludes `/assets` across
BOTH of its path shapes (extensionless and `.html`), not just the extensionless one.
Extensionless is the normal page shape here, since the default redirect rule strips trailing
slashes (`/about`), and `not … contains "."` is how the free plan says "no file extension"
(`matches` needs Business).

`cacheRules` is an ARRAY, and arrays REPLACE across the config merge chain: a brand
declaring its own `edge.providers.cloudflare.cacheRules` replaces the framework set whole
(the same doctrine as `rules.redirect`), so its block has to carry any platform rule it still
wants. A subdomain project never runs this operation at all (below) — the parent brand's
zone owns the rules its subdomains are served under. A TTL of `0` is a legal value that
reaches Cloudflare as declared rather than falling back to the default
([#754](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/754)): `browserTtl: 0` is `max-age=0`,
revalidate on every request, and a `0` edge TTL means whatever Cloudflare's own rules grammar
makes of it (a full edge bypass is a MODE there, not a TTL).

**Static hosting contributes nothing here.** The web target publishes to GitHub Pages, which
has no header configuration, and nothing in the stack writes a hosting config for the built
site — so the edge is the ONE place a brand's cache lifetimes are set
([docs/shared/deploys.md](../shared/deploys.md)).

## Templated redirects live here, not in the web config

A redirect whose destination is COMPUTED from the request path — DashQR's printed QR codes
point at `/c/<id>` for unbounded ids, and every one of them must land on `/code?id=<id>` —
cannot be enumerated as a page, and static hosting has no server to answer it with. It needs
edge computing, so `edge.providers.cloudflare.rules.redirect` is its one home
([#466](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/466)): the web target's own
`targets.web.redirects` block shipped in 0.45.0 and is retired, and a config still carrying
it fails validation naming this key.

An entry is `{ name, expression, statusCode, preserveQueryString, targetUrl, enabled }`, in
Cloudflare's own filter language — nothing is translated, because the edge is what evaluates
it:

```json5
{
  name: 'Redirect: QR short code',
  expression: '(starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/c/"))',
  statusCode: 301,
  // The target carries its OWN `?id=`, so an inbound querystring must not be appended
  preserveQueryString: false,
  targetUrl: { expression: 'concat("https://", http.host, "/code?id=", substring(http.request.uri.path, 3))' },
  enabled: true,
}
```

`targetUrl` takes `{ value }` for a fixed destination and `{ expression }` for a computed
one. The ruleset is reconciled whole — a configured rule is created or updated by `name`,
and a rule in Cloudflare that config does not name is REMOVED — so the block is the complete
desired set, the manager's platform defaults (the trailing-slash rule) included.

A redirect whose URLs CAN be enumerated is not this: it is a redirect PAGE in the web target
(`redirect.url` in frontmatter on the `modules/utilities/redirect` layout,
[docs/web/index.md](../web/index.md)).

**`omega dev` does not answer these routes** (the manager call, 2026-08-30). The edge owns
them, so `/c/<id>` is a plain 404 in dev, exactly as it is against the built output — a
local mirror of Cloudflare's filter language would exist only to disagree with production.
Verify a rule against the zone.

## Subdomain projects use the parent zone

When `brand.url` is not an apex (`playground.omegajs.dev`), the service works on the PARENT
zone (`omegajs.dev`) and runs only `zone` and `dns-records` — zone-level settings, rules and
workers belong to the parent brand. `dns-records` then only touches records belonging to the
subdomain. Creating the parent zone is inert until the registrar's nameservers point at it,
which the `domain` service handles right after.

## Gotcha: a subdomain project's API host stays DNS-only, so it gets no Cloudflare geo headers

Cloudflare's Universal SSL — every plan, free included — covers the apex and exactly ONE
label below it (`*.omegajs.dev`). A subdomain project's API host is two labels deep
(`api.playground.omegajs.dev`), so no certificate at the proxy can terminate TLS for it, and
the `cloud` service's hosting ensure leaves that CNAME **DNS-only** (grey cloud) with
Firebase serving the certificate instead (`packages/manager/src/services/cloud/ensure/hosting.js`,
`zoneTlsCoverage`). Traffic therefore never passes through Cloudflare, and Cloudflare's
visitor-location headers — the ones the `addVisitorLocationHeaders` managed transform turns
on — never reach that API. Region and city read null in the backend
([#638](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/638)) and no edge setting fixes it:
nothing is missing, the name is simply outside the certificate.

- **Top-level brands are unaffected**: `api.brand.com` is one label under the zone, Universal
  SSL covers it, the record is proxied, and the geo headers arrive.
- **The fix for a subdomain project is the paid Cloudflare add-on** — Advanced Certificate
  Manager / Total TLS on the zone. The gate already recognizes it: the hosting ensure asks the
  zone for its ACTUAL coverage (`/acm/total_tls`, then active certificate packs) and proxies
  the name the moment a certificate covers it, printing which coverage let it through. A
  lookup failure falls back to not-covered — a DNS-only record works on every plan, a wrongly
  proxied one never does.
- **The log line names it either way**: verified-but-uncovered prints "Universal SSL stops at
  `*.<zone>`; no Total TLS or deeper cert pack on this zone — CNAME stays DNS-only, Firebase
  serves the certificate".

## The SendGrid records come from SendGrid, not from config

`emailauth.<domain>`, the `<id>.<domain>` owner CNAME, `emailurl.<domain>` and both DKIM keys
are all built from one host, `u<id>.<whitelabel>.sendgrid.net`. Those values are SendGrid's own
observed facts about the domain, so `dns-records` READS them per run
(`GET /v3/whitelabel/domains`, the same client the campaigns service uses, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
from the brand `.env`) instead of carrying a config copy that nothing ever wrote back
([#692](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/692)).

Every no-answer skips the whole SendGrid set and prints the reason: no `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, no
authenticated domain for this brand's domain (the campaigns service creates it), an unreachable
SendGrid, or a `mail_cname` that is not the `u<id>.<whitelabel>.sendgrid.net` shape — that last
one names the host it got. A dry run does the same read and names the host in its plan; a
subdomain project never asks, because the apex record set belongs to the parent brand.

## Gotcha: the branded-link CNAME is grey until SendGrid validates it

`emailurl.<domain>` is the one SendGrid record that rides Cloudflare's proxy. SendGrid
validates a branded link by resolving that host as a CNAME to `sendgrid.net`, and a
Cloudflare-PROXIED record answers with the edge's own addresses instead — so proxying it
before validation locks the branding out of ever validating and every emailed link stays
broken ([#646](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/646)). The handler therefore
asks SendGrid first (`GET /v3/whitelabel/links`) and only proxies once that host reports
`valid: true`.

Since [#662](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/662) the walk WAITS for that
answer instead of leaving the flip to a later run: `pollWithSpinner` re-asks SendGrid every
10s (ENTER checks now, `s` skips) and the same pass proxies the CNAME. A skipped wait, or a
run with no TTY, keeps the record grey and returns **warned** with the reason — "SendGrid has
not validated the branded link — the emailurl CNAME stays unproxied" — so the run summary
names what is still owed. An unreachable SendGrid or a subdomain project answer NO the same
way: the unproxied record is the safe half of the pair (with no key or no authenticated
domain, the SendGrid records are skipped outright).

A host with NO link-branding entry is the one NO that never waits — the `campaigns` service
creates and validates the branding LATER IN THE SAME WALK, when campaigns is enabled for the
brand ([#693](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/693)), so waiting on it here would
never end. The line says so, the record lands grey (exactly the state SendGrid validates
against), and the step is not **warned**: there is nothing pending for this service to finish.
When the campaigns service's validation passes, it flips that same record to proxied itself;
this handler's next live read agrees, because a valid branding desires a proxied record. On a
brand's FIRST walk this handler writes no SendGrid records at all — the live domain-auth read
finds nothing yet — so the campaigns service writes both link CNAMEs itself.

## Other gotchas

- **The Speed API rejects a zone that is not active yet** (`speed.errors.zone_not_active`) —
  the operation skips until activation instead of failing.
- **A never-used ruleset phase** answers "could not find entrypoint ruleset"; that is detected,
  and the first write POSTs a new ruleset rather than PUTting a missing one.
- **Rules are matched by their `name`** (Cloudflare's `description`): rename a rule in config
  and the old one is removed and a new one created.
- **`omega-api-proxy.js`** is for a brand whose api host fronts a dedicated non-Firebase
  backend: the worker carves `/omega` (and the legacy `/backend-manager` alias) out at the
  edge and proxies it to the brand's Cloud Functions, passing everything else through.
