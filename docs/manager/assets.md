# The assets service — the brand's derived visual collateral

The `assets` service generates everything derived from the brand's logo sources: the wordmark
and combomark, colour and black SVG variants with PNG size ladders, the PSD templates and
their exports, the macOS/Windows app icons, the social profile icons, and the web favicon set.
It runs on the BOOT lane too — `omega dev` and a brand-root `omega deploy` both redistribute
it — because it is local file work the target legs consume.

**Sources** are committed brand collateral in the brand repo: `assets/logo/*.svg` and
`assets/templates/*.psd`. **Derived files** land in the gitignored `.omega/assets/`.

## What it reconciles

| Operation | What it does |
|---|---|
| `logo-gen` | Wordmark + combomark SVGs from the brandmark and `brand.font`, text rendered as PATH OUTLINES so the SVGs are self-contained. Missing-only: an existing (possibly hand-tuned) file is never overwritten. |
| `process` | Per logo source: the colour SVG as-is plus an all-black conversion, exported as SVG + PNGs at every ladder size. |
| `templates` | Seeds the brand's PSDs from the company root when missing (company-managed brands), replaces the logo and text layers, writes the PSD back, composites and exports the PNGs. |
| `icons` | macOS `.icns` and Windows `.ico`, from the composited `icon.png` the templates op produced when there is one, else the brandmark. |
| `social-icons` | The square brandmark centred on white with padding, for profile pictures. |
| `favicons` | The favicon PNG ladder, a multi-size `favicon.ico`, and `site.webmanifest` (content-diffed, since it derives from config rather than an image). |
| `reconcile` | Deletes the files inside the operations' own output dirs that the brand's current sources no longer derive ([#636](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/636)) — dropping `assets/logo/wordmark.svg` takes its variants and ladders with it. Runs last, so everything this walk generated is already derived; the derived NAMES come from the same lib the writers generate from (`lib/derived.js`). The brand's committed sources are never touched. |

## Config

- `assets.enabled: false` — skip.
- `brand.font` — a font FILE NAME without extension, resolved from the brand repo's
  `assets/fonts/` first, then the system font dirs. No font configured means nothing to
  generate a wordmark with (noted and passed); configured but not found is an ERROR — the
  config intent failed. There is no default: omega-manager packaged the company's licensed
  fonts, this port ships none.
- `brand.name`, `brand.images.brandmark` and the other brand values the templates and
  webmanifest read.

**Credentials** (optional): `MRLOGO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` / `MRLOGO_API_KEY` / `LOGO_API_ID_TOKEN`
— the product-service ladder for AI brandmark generation via MrLogo when the brand has no
`assets/logo/brandmark.svg` yet. Zero config options by design: setting a credential IS the
consent to spend the call. Interactive runs ask for optional art direction; dry runs never
mint. With no credentials the service skips with guidance.

## The force refresh

The `assets` service is mtime-diffed, so a converged brand rebuilds nothing; `omega manage --reset-assets` ([#214](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/214)) is the force refresh for the cases no timestamp records. It clears the derived cache under `.omega/assets/` before the walk, then the same operations regenerate it and the run names what was cleared. Bare resets both kinds; `--reset-assets=logos` takes the logo variants, app icons, social icons and favicons, `--reset-assets=templates` the PSD exports. The brand's committed `assets/logo/*.svg` and `assets/templates/*.psd` are sources, never cache, so they are never touched (the port of omega-manager's `--reset-logos` / `--reset-templates`).

Invalidation IS deletion: `isStale()` calls a missing derived file stale, so removing a kind's
outputs is precisely what makes the same walk regenerate them — no second freshness mechanism
to keep in sync.

## Gotchas

- **The brandmark is the root of every derived asset.** No `assets/logo/brandmark.svg` and no
  MrLogo credential means the whole service skips.
- **A PSD stores each layer's raster.** Replaced TEXT content lands in the layer metadata and
  Photoshop re-renders it on open, so a text change appears in the exports only after the PSD
  is opened and saved once. The LOGO layers are re-rastered here, so they are always current.
- **Manual Photoshop edits persist and re-trigger the pass**: editing a PSD bumps its mtime, so
  the next run re-replaces the logo/text layers and re-exports.
