# Publishing

`OMEGA_IS_PUBLISH=true npm run build` packages AND uploads to extension stores in one step.

## Supported stores

- **Chrome Web Store** (Chrome / Edge / Brave / Opera users)
- **Firefox Add-ons** (AMO)
- **Microsoft Edge Add-ons** (separate from Chrome Web Store — Edge Insiders + corporate environments)

Which stores a publish talks to is the brand's DECLARATION, `targets.<name>.platforms.<chrome|firefox|edge>.formats.store` ([#867](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/867)): presence is the switch and every store defaults on, so a brand drops one with `false`. A DECLARED store with a missing credential is not skipped: the publish refuses, naming the key, the declaration that requires it, and the walk that collects it (`omega manage --service publishing`). A declared store whose LISTING does not exist yet is neither: its zip is on the GitHub release and one manual step prints.

## Setup: two files, one rule ([#893](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/893))

Each store knows this extension by an ID, and that id is PUBLIC (it is the id in
the listing URL every user sees). Public values live in config; credentials live
in `.env`.

`config/omega.json5`, beside that store's own listing url:

```json5
targets: {
  extension: {
    type: 'extension',
    listings: {
      chrome:  { id: '...', url: 'https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/...' },
      firefox: { id: 'extension@yourbrand.com', url: 'https://addons.mozilla.org/...' },
      edge:    { id: '...', url: 'https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/...' },
    },
  },
},
```

The store API credentials go in your project's `.env` (gitignored):

```bash
# Chrome Web Store
CHROME_CLIENT_ID="..."
CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN="..."

# Firefox Add-ons
FIREFOX_API_KEY="..."
FIREFOX_API_SECRET="..."

# Microsoft Edge Add-ons
EDGE_CLIENT_ID="..."
EDGE_API_KEY="..."
```

`CHROME_EXTENSION_ID`, `FIREFOX_EXTENSION_ID` and `EDGE_PRODUCT_ID` are RETIRED
env keys: a `.env` still declaring one fails the load naming its config home.

## Getting credentials

### Chrome Web Store

1. Create an OAuth client via [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (Web application type)
2. Enable the [Chrome Web Store API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/using_webstore_api/)
3. Generate a refresh token via the OAuth flow (one-time)
4. `listings.chrome.id` is in your Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard URL: `chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/<id>`. With credentials set and no id declared, the publish refuses naming the config path

### Firefox Add-ons

1. Sign in to [Add-on Developer Hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/)
2. Generate JWT credentials at "Manage API Keys"
3. `listings.firefox.id` IS the manifest's `browser_specific_settings.gecko.id` (AMO uses it as the add-on guid): config is its one home, the package task writes it into the manifest, and a manifest declaring a different one fails the build naming both

> **Declare `listings.firefox.id` before your FIRST publish.** Packaging no longer waits for it: with none declared, the firefox pass DERIVES `extension@<brand.url host>` (or `extension@<brand.id>.extension` when the brand has no url) and builds, failing only when there are no brand facts at all to derive from, so a fresh scaffold produces an artifact out of the box. Declare your own anyway before you submit: the id must stay stable across every release, an id assigned at submission time can never be changed from a self-hosted build, and `brand.url` can change under a derived one ([#574](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/574)). A first publish WRITES the id it created the listing under back into your config, so a derived id stops being derived the moment it becomes real ([#893](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/893)). The same pass translates the chrome-only panel keys (`side_panel` → `sidebar_action`, `sidePanel` permission dropped), so the firefox artifact is a real firefox artifact ([#264](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/264)).

#### The FIRST Firefox publish carries the listing metadata ([#884](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/884))

addons.mozilla.org builds the listing from the FIRST version it receives and reuses it on every update, so a publish with `listings.firefox.id` set needs credentials and nothing else. Creating the listing is the one moment AMO demands three more fields, and without them the submission comes back after a green build:

```
WebExtError: Submission failed (2): Bad Request
  "version": { "license": [ "This field, or custom_license, is required for listed versions." ] }
```

So a publish with no `listings.firefox.id` writes `.temp/amo-metadata.json` and signs with `--amo-metadata <path>`:

| Field | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| `summary['en-US']` | `brand.description`, cut to AMO's 250-character cap with a warning naming the key. Translated summaries follow the same `translations/` the store description already uses |
| `categories` | `targets.extension.categories` in `config/omega.json5`: a list of AMO's own slugs, default `['alerts-updates']` (the most generic one that is not `other`, since AMO has no utilities or productivity slug). A slug AMO does not know fails the build listing the live set, never at the store |
| `version.license` | The target `package.json` `license` field. Absent or npm's `UNLICENSED` lists as AMO's `all-rights-reserved` (what every OMEGA scaffold writes, closed-source commercial); one of `MPL-2.0`, `Apache-2.0`, `MIT`, `ISC`, `BSD-2-Clause`, `GPL-2.0-only`, `GPL-3.0-only`, `LGPL-2.1-only`, `LGPL-3.0-only`, `AGPL-3.0-only`, `Unlicense` passes through; anything else (a compound expression, a deprecated id like `GPL-3.0`) fails loudly with that list |

Chrome and Edge pick their category and license in their own dashboards, so neither lane sends any of this.

### Microsoft Edge Add-ons

1. Sign up for the [Microsoft Edge Add-ons Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/microsoftedge)
2. Generate API credentials in the "API publishing" section
3. `listings.edge.id` is the GUID assigned to your extension by Microsoft

## Publish flow

```bash
OMEGA_IS_PUBLISH=true npm run build
```

What happens:

1. `npm run build` runs the full gulp pipeline (build → package → packaged/<browser>/raw + zip)
2. `gulp/tasks/package.js` detects `OMEGA_IS_PUBLISH=true`
3. For each browser, reads the store credentials from `.env` and the listing id from config
4. Uploads the `.zip` via each declared store's API. A missing developer key refuses before anything uploads; a missing listing id prints the manual step (create the listing, upload the zip that is already on the release, set the config path, re-run) and the rest of the run continues
5. Logs success / failure per store; exits non-zero if any upload fails

## Manual upload

Run `npm run build` without `OMEGA_IS_PUBLISH=true` — you get unsigned `.zip` files per browser under `packaged/`:

```
packaged/
├── chrome/<ExtensionName>.zip
└── firefox/<ExtensionName>.zip
```

Upload these manually via each store's web dashboard.

## CI / GitHub Actions

For automated releases, store credentials as encrypted GitHub Actions secrets. A typical workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build + publish
  env:
    OMEGA_IS_PUBLISH:        true
    CHROME_CLIENT_ID:      ${{ secrets.CHROME_CLIENT_ID }}
    CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET:  ${{ secrets.CHROME_CLIENT_SECRET }}
    CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN:  ${{ secrets.CHROME_REFRESH_TOKEN }}
    # ...same for FIREFOX_*, EDGE_*
    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SECRET: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SECRET }}
  run: npm run build
```

No listing id appears there: it is config, and the config rides the checkout.
The block is GENERATED from the env schema anyway, so a brand never types it.

**The zips also land on a GitHub release** ([#883](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/883)): after the store uploads, the publish task attaches `extension-<browser>.zip` to the tag `<target name>-v<version>` (`extension-v<version>` for the default target) in the brand's ONE public releases repo, `<brand.id>-releases` under `repo.org`: the same channel desktop distributes installers through, and where the site's download links point. Nothing names that repo: it derives from the config, and the transport is the `gh` CLI, so the credential is `GH_TOKEN` (the brand's cross-repo token, never the run-scoped `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`, which cannot reach another repo).

**The store credentials are not the only secret CI needs.** A dispatched run has no `.env`, so `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SECRET` — the Measurement Protocol secret the build BAKES into `OMEGA_BUILD_JSON` — only reaches the build through the workflow env. Without it, a CI-published extension shipped an empty secret and sent no analytics events, silently ([#582](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/582)). The scaffolded `publish.yml` injects it, and a build-mode build of a brand that HAS `analytics.providers.google.id` fails loudly when the secret is empty rather than publishing a dead sender.

Same pattern EM uses for its desktop apps. Each store does its own review afterward (Chrome / Firefox: hours to a few days; Edge: typically same day).

## What about Safari?

Safari (Apple) uses a different extension model and requires Xcode-based packaging via `safari-web-extension-converter`. Not currently in scope for @omega.js/extension's auto-publish. Manual conversion + App Store Connect upload is the route.

## Store listing description (`config/description.md`)

`config/description.md` is the Chrome Web Store listing description. When writing or rewriting it, first read `config/omega.json5` (brand), `config/messages.json` (extension name + short description), `src/manifest.json` (permissions/features), and the component JS under `src/assets/js/components/` to understand what the extension actually does — be specific about real features, not generic copy.

The package task renders `{{ brand.* }}` tokens against `config/omega.json5` before writing `packaged/assets/description/<lang>.md` — the English source and every translated variant — so the store listing carries the resolved brand, never a literal token.

```

**Rules:**

- **Keep the Bonus section and Privacy section EXACTLY as shown** — do not modify these
- Name the extension with `{{ brand.name }}` (or its literal name from `config/messages.json`) — the token resolves at package time
- Be specific about features — reference what the code actually does
- Tone: enthusiastic, conversational, persuasive; emojis for section headers and feature bullets
- Feature headlines short and punchy (under 50 characters)
- 300-500 words (excluding the Bonus and Privacy sections)

**After rewriting**, clear stale cached translations — delete `.cache/translations/description/` and the `description` key from `.cache/translate.json` — then have the user run `npm run build` to regenerate translations (see [translations.md](translations.md)).
