/**
 * `omega deploy` — the explicit publish verb (D13: commits never
 * auto-publish). Delivers the brand to its repo and dispatches the scaffolded
 * publish workflow: CI builds, uploads to the stores when credentials are
 * present, and attaches the package zip to a GitHub release (the durable
 * artifact channel).
 *
 * ONE lane, the same one every target takes
 * ([#872](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/872),
 * [#915](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/915)): the executor
 * resolves it from the brand, packs any local frameworks and force-pushes a
 * SNAPSHOT of the brand folder to `omega-deploy`, the one branch CI ever
 * builds, and then it waits for the workflow and dispatches. A
 * linked tree no longer switches itself to the direct lane; `--direct` is how a
 * human asks for that.
 *
 * Every run starts with the local scaffold the retired `omega setup` used to
 * own (ensureTarget, #675); a DISPATCH then runs setup's NETWORK half as a
 * precheck before it sends. `--no-secrets` skips that precheck, and `--direct`
 * never reaches it at all.
 *
 * Flags: --dry-run (print the exact dispatch, send nothing; skips the push),
 * --direct (build + store-publish from this machine: the ONE command CI runs).

/**
 * The direct lane, asked for by a human (`--direct`,
 * [#872](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/872)): build +
 * store-publish from THIS machine, with whatever frameworks are linked here
 * bundled in. It used to select itself whenever the tree carried a `file:`
 * spec, which took the CI lane away from the brands that need it most; a
 * linked brand now packs its frameworks into the snapshot the runner installs.
 *
 * ONE command, the one CI runs ([#865](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/865)):
 * the build already ENDS in the publish task (`gulp/main.js`'s `exports.build`),
 * so the `npm run build && npm run publish` script this used to run entered
 * that task twice and published the same version to every store twice over.
 * The publish flag rides the env the way the workflow sets it, so the local
 * lane and the CI lane are the same one process.
 *
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {boolean} [options.dryRun] - Print what would run, run nothing.
 * @param {function} [options.exec] - Injectable shell (tests).
