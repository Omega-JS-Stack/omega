/**
 * The client runtime's analytics — a HOST of `@omega.js/analytics`, never a
 * second implementation of it ([#328](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/328),
 * stage E).
 *
 * `manager.analytics().event('<canonical>', params)` resolves through the shared
 * catalog and adapters, exactly like a web page's call sites and the backend's
 * webhook. What differs per runtime is the TRANSPORT, and this module is where
 * each one is injected:
 *
 *   web                    the PAGE's transport — the guarded gtag/fbq/ttq the
 *                          web host wired (`core/js/libs/analytics.js`), which
 *                          also owns the consent gate and the attribution
 *                          context. Nothing is configured here beyond the
 *                          environment: a page's seams are the page's.
 *   electron / extension   the Measurement Protocol, fed by the GA4 descriptor.
 *                          Meta and TikTok resolve and then skip — no pixel
 *                          exists in these runtimes to receive them.
 *   desktop renderer       NO transport at all: the injected IPC bridge
 *                          ([#411](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/411)).
 *                          Events forward to the main process, whose sender
 *                          owns the one device id, the one session id and the
 *                          real engagement time — one install, one GA client.
 *
 * Identity is real here (#159 is closed): `setUserId` / `setUserProperties` SEND
 * on web through the page's gtag instead of storing values only the Measurement
 * Protocol payload ever read.
