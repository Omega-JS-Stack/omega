## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`modules/motion.js` — the shared animation engine (classy v2, C3).** Icon-renderer-pattern factory (`createMotion()` → `start/stop/scan`) driving the `data-omega-*` motion attributes: scroll reveals (+ parent stagger), count-ups (final value lives in markup; parser handles `$`, `%`, commas, decimals, suffixes), word rotators, seamless marquee track duplication, and scroll-position watchers. Resilient by contract: no-JS pages render visible, `prefers-reduced-motion` gets static final states, missing observers degrade to instant reveal. Booted by @omega.js/web's `core/js/core/motion.js`; desktop/extension pick it up at C4.
- **`ServiceWorker.unregisterAll()`** — unregisters every worker claiming the origin; called automatically when `serviceWorker.enabled` is false so a previous project's worker can't keep serving stale caches on a shared localhost port.

### Changed
- **Cookie-consent default palette rides the `--omega-*` tokens** (surface/ink with hard fallbacks) instead of the legacy electric-blue `#237afc` — the banner now matches whatever theme the page runs. Consumer `cookieConsent.config.palette` overrides behave exactly as before.
- **Service worker registration is dev-inclusive and takeover-safe**: registration happens in every environment (push and cache behavior are testable locally); same-scope registration + the worker's own cache eviction make one localhost port safe across different projects.

### Fixed
- **icon-core treats `fa-2xs` (real Font Awesome size) and the legacy UJM house sizes `fa-md`/`fa-3xl` as modifiers** — previously they parsed as icon NAMES, which 404'd (`solid/md.svg`) and, worse, wiped build-time-inlined icons off the page when the renderer re-scanned them.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-07-10

### BREAKING
- **Package renamed `web-manager` → `@omegajs/client`** (5.0.0 continues the 4.x line; web-manager 4.x is frozen at 4.3.6 in the legacy repo — old-name publishes come from there, all new work lands here). Import specifiers flip everywhere — `import webManager from '@omegajs/client'`, subpaths `@omegajs/client/modules/*` — including @omegajs/web's bundler alias, so consumer page code writes the new name too.
- **Deliberately NOT renamed:** the runtime API — the `webManager` singleton, `window.webManager`, and every method — is unchanged; only the package name moved. `omega:wm` skill refs ride the Phase-5 skills rewrite.
- License CC-BY-4.0 → MIT.

### Fixed
- **The `module` field no longer points bundlers at un-vendored source.** `"module": "src/index.js"` routed exports-unaware tooling into `src/`, where `modules/auth.js` bare-imports `@omegajs/account` — a devDep vendored only into `dist/vendor` — so consumer bundles failed on a package they don't have. The `exports` map (dist, vendored) is now the only entry surface; `src/` still ships for debugging.

### Removed
- Legacy `repository`/`bugs`/`homepage` package fields and the README badge header + legacy repo links (sister-style header instead).

## [4.3.6] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- **`[Firebase] Skipped:` console line when Firebase init is skipped** — when the resolved config has no non-empty `apiKey` (Firebase-less site, or the empty framework merge blob 4.3.5 started ignoring), `initialize()` now says so in the console instead of skipping silently, matching the existing `[Analytics] Skipped:` idiom. Makes both the intentional case and a botched config instantly diagnosable.

---
## [4.3.5] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- **Firebase no longer initializes on all-empty config blobs** — `_resolveFirebaseConfig()` now requires at least one non-empty value, and initialization additionally requires a non-empty `apiKey`. Framework config merges (e.g. UJM's Jekyll chain, which can't delete the base template's empty-string Firebase keys) inject `{apiKey: "", ...}` blobs into Firebase-less sites; those used to trigger `initializeApp()` and crash every page with `auth/invalid-api-key`. Configs carrying only `projectId`/`authDomain` still resolve for `getFunctionsUrl()`/`getApiUrl()` URL derivation — Firebase just stays uninitialized without an `apiKey`. Consumers that stripped the empty blob themselves (e.g. pre-init `delete window.Configuration.firebase` workarounds) can remove the workaround. See `docs/architecture.md` § Firebase Initialization.

---
## [4.3.4] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **`isValidRedirectUrl` accepts loopback redirect URLs while the site runs in development** — `127.0.0.1` / `[::1]` / `localhost` on ANY port (RFC 8252 §7.3). This is the return channel for native-app sign-in in dev: Electron Manager's `openAuthFlow()` can't OS-register its custom scheme in dev builds, so the `/token` page redirects the minted token to the app's ephemeral loopback listener instead. Production sites are unaffected (the branch is gated on `isDevelopment()`); the existing same-host / `brand.id:` scheme / `validRedirectHosts` rules are unchanged.

### Changed
- **Dev API URL is now `https://localhost:5002`** (was `http://`) — backend-manager's `mgr serve` has exposed the local API through an HTTPS-only mkcert proxy on 5002 since BEM 5.7.0, and plain http:// cannot connect to it (the frontend's dev API calls failed outright). Requires consumers to run a BEM ≥ 5.7.0 `mgr serve` for local dev.

---
## [4.3.3] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- **OMEGA mirror mandate** — `CLAUDE.md` (Doc-update parity) now states WM follows the library subset of the canonical OMEGA CLAUDE.md skeleton; structural changes require checking the sister repos (canonical skeletons: `omega:main` skill's mirror-spec resource).
- **`docs/cdp-debugging.md`** — WM joins the mirrored browser-debugging doc (UJM/BEM/BXM/EM/WM): per-session isolated Chrome via the `chrome-devtools` MCP, WM flavor = verify WM behavior by driving a consuming site (UJM dev server at `https://localhost:4000` — never the LAN IP), exercising auth/bindings/Firestore from the real browser. Indexed in CLAUDE.md.

## [4.3.2] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **`docs/bindings.md`**: full `data-wm-bind` deep reference migrated from the `omega:ujm` skill into the repo (the module that implements the feature) — actions table, comma-separated multi-binding syntax + parser caveat, condition operators, auth/usage/custom state paths, JS API, skeleton-loader lifecycle (`wm-binding-skeleton` → `wm-bound`), multi-phase binding, composite-text pattern, and root-key update filtering. Linked from CLAUDE.md and `docs/modules.md`. Part of the skills-as-routers refactor: framework facts live in repo docs (version-matched via `node_modules`).

### Changed
- **Dependency bumps**: `@sentry/browser` `^10.54.0` → `^10.57.0`, `firebase` `^12.13.0` → `^12.14.0`.

---
## [4.2.0] - 2026-05-21
### Added
- **Consent defaults in `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT`.** Phase A companion to `backend-manager` v5.2.0's marketing-consent system. `src/modules/auth.js` now defaults `account.consent.{legal,marketing}` to the canonical shape (`status: 'revoked'`, `grantedAt`/`revokedAt` with null leaves) so `resolveAccount()` always populates the field for legacy users whose Firestore doc predates the consent system. Without this, the account-page email-preferences toggle would read `undefined` for pre-migration users and mis-state.
- **`docs/<topic>.md` deep references.** New `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/build-system.md`, `docs/code-patterns.md`, `docs/common-tasks.md`, `docs/dependencies.md`, `docs/modules.md`, `docs/testing.md`. Mirrors the architectural-overview-plus-deep-references pattern used in `backend-manager` and `electron-manager`.

### Changed
- **`CLAUDE.md` refactored to the architectural-overview pattern.** Trimmed from 301 lines to ~80; per-subsystem detail moved to the new `docs/*.md` files. Keeps Claude's loaded-context cost down on every conversation.

### Fixed
- **Toast notification width.** `src/modules/utilities.js`: notifications now have `width: calc(100% - 2rem); max-width: 500px` so longer text doesn't render as a narrow cramped strip at the top of the page.

---
## [4.1.42] - 2026-05-11
### Changed
- **Firebase config: presence-driven + flat shape canonical.** Firebase now initializes when a `firebaseConfig` blob is present in config (matching BEM/BXM/EM/OMEGA shape) — no separate `firebase.app.enabled` flag needed. Removes the `enabled` redundancy where consumers had to set both a credentials blob AND flip a flag.
- New internal helper `_resolveFirebaseConfig()` reads flat `config.firebaseConfig` first (canonical), falls back to nested `config.firebase.app.config` (UJM legacy yaml). Used by `_initializeFirebase`, `getFunctionsUrl`, `getApiUrl`, `service-worker.js`, and `auth.js#listen` (Firebase-not-configured short-circuit).
- `_initializeFirebase` now reuses an existing `[DEFAULT]` Firebase app if present (via `getApps()` / `getApp()`) instead of throwing `app/duplicate-app` on re-init (live reload, test re-runs).
- No backwards-compat shim needed for UJM: both shapes resolve. UJM can migrate to the flat `firebaseConfig` shape on its own schedule; until then, its `firebase.app.config` keeps working.

---
## [4.1.41] - 2026-05-10
### Changed
- Bumped dependencies: `@sentry/browser` ^10.47.0 → ^10.52.0, `firebase` ^12.11.0 → ^12.13.0, `prepare-package` ^2.0.7 → ^2.1.0.
- Added empty `hooks: {}` to `preparePackage` config to align with prepare-package 2.1.0 schema.

---
## [4.1.40] - 2026-05-10
### Changed
- **BREAKING (internal)**: `_resolveUsage()` now reads `config.payment.products` instead of `config.payment.plans`. Aligns with OMEGA's canonical shape (the SSOT) — same key name in BEM, UJM, EM. No backwards-compat shim; consumers must use `payment.products`. Default in `_processConfiguration()` updated from `plans: []` to `products: []`. Renamed local vars `plan`/`plans`/`planConfig` → `productId`/`products`/`product`. CLAUDE.md updated.

---
## [4.1.39] - 2026-04-10
### Changed
- Converted `Utilities` methods to arrow class fields so `this` is permanently bound to the instance, allowing methods to be destructured, aliased, or passed as callbacks without losing context.

---
## [4.1.38] - 2026-04-08
### Added
- Added `sanitizeURL()` utility method that validates URLs against dangerous URI schemes (javascript:, data:, etc.), allowing only http: and https: protocols.

## [4.1.37] - 2026-04-05
### Added
- Added `_resolveUsage()` to auth module that merges account usage data with plan limits from config, exposed as a top-level `usage` binding context.
- Added `payment.processors` and `payment.plans` defaults to configuration.

## [4.1.36] - 2026-04-02
### Fixed
- Fixed mocha binary path preventing `npm test` from running.
- Fixed lodash ESM named import incompatibility with Node.js (`storage.js`).
- Fixed test suite calling nonexistent API methods (`init` → `initialize`, `storage('local')` → `storage()`).
- Fixed mocha hanging after tests due to `setInterval` in version checker (added `--exit` flag).

### Changed
- Enhanced `escapeHTML` to recursively handle objects, arrays, and pass through non-string types.
- Rewrote `showNotification` to use safe DOM construction (`textContent`) instead of `innerHTML`.
- Split monolithic `test.js` into 8 modular test files under `test/tests/`.
- Expanded test coverage from ~10 broken tests to 70 passing tests.

### Security
- Blocked `javascript:` protocol in `@attr` bindings for URL attributes (`href`, `src`, `action`, `formaction`).

---

---
## [4.1.31] - 2026-03-24
### Changed
- Switched from `getFirestore` to `initializeFirestore` in `index.js` to support custom Firestore configuration options.
- Removed redundant `getFirestore` from firestore module's stored methods since the instance is already initialized in `index.js`.

---

### Changed
- Bumped `@sentry/browser` from `^10.43.0` to `^10.45.0`.

---
## [4.1.29] - 2026-03-19
### Changed
- Restructured notification subscription documents to use nested `metadata.created` and `metadata.updated` timestamps instead of top-level fields.
- Update operations now use dot-notation (`metadata.updated`) to preserve `metadata.created` when updating existing subscriptions.

---
## [4.1.28] - 2026-03-15
### Changed
- Bumped `chatsy` from `^2.0.5` to `^2.0.8`.
- Upgraded `prepare-package` from `^1.2.6` to `^2.0.7` (major version with esbuild bundler).

---
## [4.1.25] - 2026-03-13
### Added
- Automatically attach resolved subscription state (`state.resolved`) to auth state during processing, making `plan`, `active`, `trialing`, and `cancelling` available to bindings and consumers without manual calls.

---
## [4.1.24] - 2026-03-13
### Added
- Added `resolveSubscription()` method to Auth module that derives calculated subscription fields (plan, active, trialing, cancelling) from raw backend data.

---
## [4.1.22] - 2026-03-11
### Changed
- Renamed `config.tracking` to `config.analytics` with simplified property names: `google-analytics` → `google`, `google-analytics-secret` → `googleSecret`, `meta-pixel` → `meta`, `tiktok-pixel` → `tiktok`.

---
## [4.1.19] - 2026-03-11
### Added
- Added new chatsy import.

---
## [4.1.15] - 2026-02-26
### Fixed
- Fixed bindings skeleton removal happening prematurely when partial context updates didn't match any of the element's bindings.

### Changed
- `_executeAction` now returns a boolean indicating whether the action was processed, allowing `update()` to defer skeleton removal until at least one binding runs.

---
## [4.1.10] - 2026-02-17
### Changed
- Refactored auth to use promise-based settler pattern (`_authReady`) for reliable auth state detection, eliminating race conditions with late-registered listeners.
- Split `listen()` into two clear paths: `once` (waits for settler, fires once) and persistent (subscribes to all changes, catches up if already settled).
- Renamed `onAuthStateChanged` to `_subscribe` (internal-only).
- Removed unused `_readyCallbacks`.

---
## [4.1.1] - 2025-12-17
### Added
- Added `getBrowser()` utility to detect browser type (chrome, firefox, safari, edge, opera, brave).
- Added `data-browser` HTML attribute set during initialization.
- Added `browser` and `vendor` fields to `getContext().client`.
- Added `geolocation` object to `getContext()` with placeholder fields (ip, country, region, city, latitude, longitude).

### Changed

- Replaced `browser` object with `geolocation` object in `getContext()` return structure.

---

- Added `runtime` config option for explicit runtime override.
- Added `buildTimeISO` auto-calculated from `buildTime`.
- Added `usage` data to bindings context for UI display.

### Changed
- Refactored `utilities.js` from standalone functions to class pattern for consistency with other modules.
- Simplified `getApiUrl()` to always prepend `api.` subdomain instead of replacing first subdomain.

## [4.0.33] - 2025-12-12
### BREAKING
- `@text` binding action no longer auto-detects input/textarea elements. Use `@value` for inputs instead.

### Added
