// Real macOS notarization implementation. Lives inside @omega.js/desktop — consumers can extend it via
// hooks/notarize/post.js (called after this completes successfully).
//
// Uses Apple's notarytool with the App Store Connect API key. Legacy Apple ID + app-specific
// password flow is deliberately NOT supported.
//
// Required env vars:
//   APPLE_API_KEY     — path to AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 (set by @omega.js/desktop CI workflow from base64-encoded secret)
//   APPLE_API_KEY_ID  — 10-char Key ID (matches the XXXXXXXXXX in the filename)
//   APPLE_API_ISSUER  — issuer UUID from App Store Connect → Users and Access → Keys
//
// Skipped ONLY when building for a non-darwin platform. Every other state is a
// THROW ([#891](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/891)): a mac
// build that reaches this hook is a mac build this framework ships, and a build
// that cannot be signed and notarized must not become a release.
//   - missing APPLE_API_KEY / _ID / _ISSUER: nothing can notarize it
//   - no Developer ID signature (#872): electron-builder SKIPS signing when it
//     finds no identity and leaves an ad-hoc signature behind, which notarytool
//     rejects ("Failed to codesign your application"). That state used to warn
//     and carry on, and the release published an app Gatekeeper refuses on every
//     other Mac.
//
// After notarization the ticket is STAPLED and the result PROVED (stapler
// validate + spctl --assess): the hook returns only when the .app on disk is
// one a user's Mac will open offline. The DMG gets the same treatment in its
// own hook (notarize-artifacts.js, artifactBuildCompleted), because the ticket
// stapled to the app inside an image is not stapled to the image.
