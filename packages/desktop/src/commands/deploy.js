/**
 * `omega deploy` — the uniform explicit publish verb (D13). Desktop's real
 * flow lives in `omega release` (workflow_dispatch + live CI log streaming +
 * GitHub-release artifacts); this verb exists so every target deploys the
 * same way. --dry-run prints the exact dispatch release would send, without
 * sending it; anything else delegates to release.
 *
 * Every run starts with the local scaffold the retired `omega setup` used to
 * own (ensureTarget, #675). A DISPATCH then runs setup's NETWORK half as a
 * precheck: framework freshness, cert validation, repo provisioning, secret
 * publication. `--no-secrets` skips that precheck, and `--direct` never
 * reaches it at all.
 *
 * `--direct` is the direct lane, asked for by a human
 * ([#872](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/872)): `omega publish
 * --local` for THIS machine's platform. It used to select itself whenever the
 * tree was linked, which took the CI lane away from the brands that need it
 * most; a linked brand now packs its frameworks into the snapshot instead.
