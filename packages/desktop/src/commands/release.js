// release: trigger the GitHub Actions Build & Release workflow, then follow the
// run it started.
//
// Replaces the old "do it from my laptop" release flow with "let CI do it, but make it
// feel local." User runs `npm run release` (or `npx omega release`) and gets:
//   1. The ONE deploy lane every target takes (`@omega.js/devkit/deploy`'s
//      deployViaDispatch, #872, #915): the composed workflow files reach the
//      default branch when they differ there (GitHub registers a workflow from
//      that branch), the brand folder is force-pushed to `omega-deploy` (packed
//      when it is linked), and the workflow is dispatched on that ref (the
//      brand's own repo and the composed workflow name: devkit's
//      dispatchTarget, #847).
//   2. The ONE run follower every dispatched deploy uses
//      (`@omega.js/devkit/deploy-follow`, [#873](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/873)):
//      it finds the run, polls it, prints each job's log with the job's name in
//      front, and exits 1 on any conclusion but success. This file owned that
//      follower alone until #873 gave the other three targets the same one.
//   3. Everything teed to <root>/logs/deploy.log, the one name every target's
//      deploy writes (docs/shared/logging.md), ANSI stripped from the file.
