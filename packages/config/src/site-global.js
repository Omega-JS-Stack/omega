/**
 * site-global.js — shape a resolved omega.json5 config as the Jekyll-style
 * `site.*` global, so existing template references port verbatim to the new
 * SSG (plan §2: toSiteGlobal()).
 *
 * Scoped by the real-usage audit (2026-07-06) of UJM's theme/blueprints +
 * somiibo: config-owned keys referenced in templates are the resolved
 * config's own shape, so this is an identity mapping plus: machinery keys
 * stripped (`targets`, `enabled`), `url` derived (explicit url, else
 * brand.url), `baseurl` defaulted. ENGINE-owned keys (posts, pages, data,
 * time) are the SSG's job, not config's. `collections` is NOT one of them
 * (#207): it is the config-carried collections DECLARATION
 * (`targets.web.collections`), which rides the identity mapping like any
 * other section and which the engine reads to generate each declared
 * collection's pages.
 *
 * The resolved config for target 'web' already overlays targets.web onto the
 * top level, so web-specific sections land here automatically.
 *
 * site.targets (#85) is a CURATED view of the raw `targets` machinery —
 * an explicit allow-list of display-safe facts (presence, the derived
 * desktop releases URL, extension store listings), never a spread of the
 * raw config. It is the ONLY home of those facts
 * ([#610](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/610)): the
 * `/download` page, the `/extension` page and the shortlink generator all
 * read `site.targets.desktop.releasesUrl` and
 * `site.targets.extension.listings` directly. The legacy UJM-shaped
 * `download`/`extension` page maps — and the derivation that filled them —
 * are gone; the validator refuses a config still carrying either key.
 *
 * The desktop derivation is OPT-IN (#124): only a brand that carries a
 * `targets.desktop.releases` block gets releases/latest links — merely
 * declaring a desktop target derives nothing, since the release may not
 * exist yet. WHICH repo those links address is not decided here: it is
 * [repo.js](repo.js)'s `releasesRepo`, the one home of the brand's public
 * releases repo (#799/#883): `<brand.id>-releases` under the brand's one
 * `repo.org`, with no override key anywhere.
 *
 * Beside the hub sits `downloads` ([#620](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/620)):
 * one DIRECT-download URL per FORMAT, so a download button hands over a file
 * instead of a GitHub page. Both the format keys and the filenames are
 * [platforms.js](platforms.js)'s, the same table @omega.js/desktop packages
 * under, and they carry no version, so releasing a desktop build never touches
 * the website. A `store` format (the snap) has no file: its URL is the store
 * page itself ([#867](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/867)).
