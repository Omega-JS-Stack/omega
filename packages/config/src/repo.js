/**
 * @omega.js/config repo: the ONE derivation of every repo a brand owns
 * ([#883](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/883)).
 *
 * ONE config block says where a brand hosts its code:
 *
 *   repo: { provider: 'github', org: 'Acme-Org' }
 *
 * and nothing else. Presence of the block enables the repo service, exactly
 * as a target's key presence enables a target; `provider` defaults to `github`
 * and `org` is the only typed value. No repo NAME is ever configured: every
 * name derives from the `<brand.id>-<role>` rule (Ian 2026-09-07,
 * [#809](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/809)), one function per
 * role, so nobody types a repo name to get the right one:
 *
 *   - `<brand.id>-omega`    the SOURCE monorepo (`sourceRepo`)
 *   - `<brand.id>-releases` the public release channel (`releasesRepo`)
 *   - `<brand.id>-<name>`   one per web target that GitHub hosts (`websiteRepo`)
 *
 * A repo name that must differ is a brand id that must differ: the override
 * keys (`repo.providers.github.repo`, the top-level `github` block,
 * `targets.<name>.github.repo`, `targets.desktop.releases.owner/repo`) are
 * retired, each with a row in retired-keys.js.
 *
 * Visibility is NOT in omega.json5 either: the brand root's package.json
 * `private` field is the one statement of it (`brandVisibility`), absent
 * meaning private, because every brand monorepo is private by default
 * (Ian 2026-09-11).
