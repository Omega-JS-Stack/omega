/**
 * @omega.js/config platforms: the ONE shipping vocabulary and the ONE format
 * table ([#867](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/867)), the
 * successor of desktop-artifacts.js.
 *
 * The vocabulary is the CLIENT's (@omega.js/client's `getPlatform()` /
 * `getBrowser()`): platforms `mac`, `windows`, `linux`, `chrome`, `firefox`,
 * `edge`; formats `dmg`, `nsis`, `deb`, `appimage`, `snap`, `zip`, `store`.
 * `mac`, never `macos`, because that is the word a stored login record, a
 * download card and a `/download/<platform>` URL already carry. Node's
 * `darwin`/`win32` and electron-builder's `mac`/`win`/`AppImage`/`nsis` are
 * FOREIGN vocabularies, each translated at exactly one point (the desktop
 * framework's `utils/platform.js` for Node's, its `gulp/tasks/build-config.js`
 * for electron-builder's).
 *
 * Two things live here, and every target reads them the same way:
 *
 *   1. PLATFORMS: what a target can ship to at all.
 *   2. FORMATS: per target, platform and format, what that format IS
 *      (`kind: 'asset'` = a file on the brand's releases repo, with an `ext`;
 *      `kind: 'store'` = a publish to somebody's store), the env keys it
 *      cannot ship without (`requires`), and the per-listing CONFIG paths a
 *      store needs before it can accept an upload (`listing`, #893: the ids
 *      are config, never .env keys).
 *
 * A brand DECLARES what it ships in one shape on both targets:
 * `targets.<name>.platforms.<platform>.formats.<format>`. Presence is the
 * switch, every platform and format defaults ON, and a default is dropped with
 * `false` (the `certificates: false` idiom). Per-format settings live inside
 * the format (`linux.formats.snap.channels`,
 * `firefox.formats.store.channel`), which is why the declaration is an object
 * and not a list.
 *
 * Everything that ships derives from here: the desktop build's electron-builder
 * target lists, the website's `/download/<platform>/<format>` links, and the
 * manage walk's per-brand list of ship credentials.
