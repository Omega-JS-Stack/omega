/**
 * client-config.js: the ONE browser-safe subset of a resolved config
 * ([#894](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/894)).
 *
 * Three surfaces bake a config into an artifact a browser can read: web's page
 * chrome, desktop's renderer bundle, and every extension bundle. Each one used
 * to decide what may go public on its own, three different ways (desktop
 * shipped the WHOLE resolved config, the extension kept a hand-written allow
 * list, web wired a subset together in its engine and its foot include), so a
 * new public value had to be added in three places and every one of them could
 * be the place it leaked.
 *
 * This is that decision, once. The schema's `CLIENT_SECTIONS` says which
 * sections a browser may see (and how much of each), the list below says which
 * BUILD FACTS ride beside them, and nothing else leaves the build. All three
 * bakes call this and wrap the answer identically:
 *
 *   OMEGA_BUILD_JSON = { config: clientConfig(resolved), package, mode, license, builtAt }
 *
 * Secrets are a loud failure, not a filter: a secret-shaped key inside a
 * section that is about to ship means the resolved config carried one at all,
 * which loadConfig() and validateConfig() already refuse. A value a build is
 * SANCTIONED to bake (`publicAtRest`, docs/shared/config.md) comes from .env
 * and is added by that build after this gate, never carried through it.
