/**
 * Canonical schema for the .env cascade — pure data, no logic
 * ([#581](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/581)).
 *
 * The omega.json5 sibling of schema.js: ONE place that says which env keys
 * OMEGA needs, who owns each, which targets read it, whether OMEGA mints it
 * or a human pastes it from a third party, whether it is required, and what
 * it does. Everything that used to hand-keep its own list derives from here —
 * the manager's mint lane (the keys with a `generated` function), its
 * canonical .env grouping, the per-verb target delivery (composeTargetEnv in
 * env.js), and the backend's env reader (libraries/env.js), which refuses to
 * boot without a required key.
 *
 * Entry format mirrors schema.js's rule objects:
 *
 *   {
 *     name:        'OMEGA_ADMIN_KEY',      // the env var (SCREAMING_SNAKE)
 *     match:       /^CONNECTIONS_.+$/,     // …or a pattern, for dynamic families
 *     owner:       'workspace',            // the manager service that owns it
 *                                          // ('backend' = the framework itself)
 *     targets:     ['backend'],            // the targets whose runtime READS it
 *     group:       'omega',                // its ENV_GROUPS bucket (file order)
 *     generated:   () => randomBytes(32)…, // the function that MINTS a value
 *     default:     'value',                // …or a static default, where one applies
 *     secret:      true,                   // never printed, never in omega.json5
 *     required:    true,                   // absent = the backend refuses to boot
 *     deliverAs:   'GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SECRET', // the name it lands under in the
 *                                          // target's composed .env (see below)
 *     delivery:    { backend: 'env' },      // HOW it reaches each target
 *     publicAtRest: true,                  // …and, for a bake, that anyone who
 *                                          // unpacks the app may read it
 *     requiredWhen: holds('analytics.providers.google.id'), // when the
 *                                          // config depends on it (env-when.js)
 *     askedWhen:   asks({ captcha: onUnlessOff('…enabled') }), // per service, when
 *                                          // `omega manage` asks for it
 *     machineLocal: true,                  // a developer-machine value (a local
 *                                          // path): never published to CI
 *     label:       'Snap Store credentials', // the human name an ask opens with
 *     url:         'https://snapcraft.io/account', // the page that MINTS it
 *     hint:        'Run `snapcraft export-login -`', // how to get it there
 *     description: 'What the key drives.',
 *   }
 *
 * `label`, `url` and `hint` are the HUMAN half, and this schema is their one
 * home ([#867](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/867)): the
 * manager's REQUIRES registry used to carry a second copy per service, so a key
 * no service had wired up (every desktop signing key, every extension store
 * key) had no mint page anywhere and nobody could be asked for it. `label` is
 * what the setup gate opens with, `url` is the page a human pastes the value
 * FROM (the manage walk's Enter-to-open target, and what publish prints when a
 * key is missing), and `hint` is the one line that says what to do on that
 * page. `url: null` is a deliberate statement that no page mints this value,
 * and such an entry owes a `hint` saying where it does come from (a token a
 * portal authorization returns, a path on the developer's own box). The
 * manager's registry keeps only its own fields (which service asks, whether the
 * ask is interactive, what Disable writes).
 *
 * `generated:` is the mint switch: the manager writes those keys into a brand
 * .env (at onboard and on every manage that finds one missing) because no
 * dashboard exists to paste them from. Everything else is a third-party
 * credential a human provides. A key is minted OR defaulted, never both, and
 * only a key OMEGA can produce may be `required` — refusing every boot over a
 * secret nobody can mint would be a hostage note, not a guard.
 *
 * `targets:` is the composition domain: composeTargetEnv (env.js) composes a
 * target's own .env from the company/brand layers' keys whose targets include
 * it — the backend's is the ONLY one that ships with a deploy artifact and so
 * cannot walk up to the brand layer at runtime. Every other target reads brand
 * values through the runtime cascade, so their `targets` entries are mostly
 * documentation.
 *
 * `group:` picks the .env section the key renders into. A group with
 * `file: false` never reaches a brand .env at all — the backend resolves those
 * keys some other way (from config at boot, from the target's own .env, from
 * the developer's own shell) — so they are neither rendered as placeholders
 * nor composed from the brand layer.
 *
 * `deliverAs:` is the RENAME on delivery: the key is written into a brand .env
 * under its own name (the per-target GA4 secrets are `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SECRET_
 * <TARGET>` there, because one brand holds one per stream) and reaches its
 * target under `deliverAs` (`GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_SECRET` — a target only ever has
 * one stream). applyDeliverAs (env.js) is the one place it happens, on every
 * verb: composed into dist/.env for the backend, loaded into process.env at
 * CLI boot for the others. Absent = delivered under its own name.
 *
 * A key that must differ between a local run and a deployed one is NOT a second
 * entry here ([#586](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/586)): one
 * key, and the brand's `.env.<environment>` overlay carries the other value.
 * The schema declares WHAT a brand supplies, never which environment supplies
 * it — env.js's cascade owns that.
 *
 * `delivery:` is HOW the key reaches each target it names — the declaration
 * that replaced three unrelated hand-kept lists
 * ([#627](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/627)):
 *
 *   - `'env'`  : read from the composed .env the target runs with. On the
 *                backend that file ships with the deploy artifact; on every
 *                other target it is the composed .env on the DEVELOPER'S
 *                machine, so an `env` delivery there declares the local
 *                channel and renders no workflow line at all
 *                ([#819](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/819)).
 *   - `'ci'`   — the generated workflow injects it into the runner env for the
 *                build step.
 *   - `'bake'` — the build writes the value INTO the shipped artifact, because
 *                a packaged app (desktop, extension) runs with no .env. A bake
 *                implies its `'ci'` half: the workflow injects, then the build
 *                bakes. Anyone who unpacks the app can read a baked value, so
 *                a baking entry must declare `publicAtRest: true` — the
 *                renderer REFUSES to bake a `secret: true` entry without it.
 *
 * A target absent from `delivery` gets nothing: no workflow line, no bake, no
 * repo secret. env-delivery.js is the ONE reader — every workflow secrets
 * block, bake list and push-secrets set derives from these declarations, so a
 * new key is one entry here and nothing else.
 *
 * `requiredWhen:` and `askedWhen:` are the two "when" facts, each written with
 * the named rules of env-when.js. `requiredWhen` is one rule: the brand's
 * config now depends on the key, so a deploy, a bake or a production start
 * refuses without it. `askedWhen` (`asks`) maps each manager service that asks
 * for the key to the rule that turns the ask on; the person may skip it. They differ
 * on purpose: the Sentry token is asked before a Sentry project exists,
 * because the manager creates the project with it. The keys a ship format
 * needs are neither: the format table in platforms.js is their one home.
 * missingEnvKeys (env-needs.js) is the ONE reader of all three.
