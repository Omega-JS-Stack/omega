/**
 * omega.json5 discovery + loading.
 *
 * ONE authored location per project dir: config/omega.json5. A deployed
 * backend still resolves its staged functions/config/omega.json5 naturally —
 * the runtime's projectDir IS the functions dir (its cwd), so the staged file
 * is that dir's own config/omega.json5. The old second probe location
 * (functions/config under the TARGET root) died with the src/dist pillar: the
 * staged compose output must never read back as an authored local layer, or a
 * brand edit goes stale behind the previous stage.
 *
 * Brand-monorepo hierarchy: when projectDir is a target inside a brand
 * monorepo ({brand}/targets/{target}), the brand root's config/omega.json5 is the
 * brand layer under the target's file, and a brand naming a company
 * (`company: { id }`) inherits that company's own config/omega.json5 underneath
 * that (#677). Resolution for a target:
 *
 *   schema defaults ← framework defaults ← company ← company.<environment> ← brand shared ← brand targets[name] ← brand.<environment> ← local shared ← local targets[name] ← local.<environment>
 *
 * The bottom layer derives from the schema's own `default:` entries
 * ([#478](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/478)) — the one home
 * of every default. `options.defaults` sits above it for the cases where a
 * framework genuinely differs.
 *
 * The company file layers exactly like the brand file (shared, then its
 * targets[name] entry) minus its `brands` key, which is company plumbing that
 * means nothing inside a brand.
 *
 * Every layer is TWO files, not one
 * ([#856](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/856)): its omega.json5
 * and the `omega.<environment>.json5` overlay beside it, which wins over its
 * OWN base and still loses to the layer above (each file keeping the
 * shared-then-targets[name] split). The environment is envEnvironment()'s
 * answer, exactly the vocabulary the `.env.<environment>` overlays are suffixed
 * with (#586), so ONE word names the config overlay, the env overlay and the
 * runtime's own environment. Only the RUNNING environment's overlay composes,
 * and a missing overlay is nothing. A file named for anything else
 * (`omega.staging.json5`) is not a layer at all, so nothing reads it and there
 * is nothing to warn about. An overlay holds only the OVERRIDES: the validator
 * judges the merged result, never an overlay on its own.
 *
 * Targets are keyed by NAME (#886): the target dir IS the name
 * (targets/community → the `community` entry), and that entry is the target
 * layer of the chain. A standalone project has no such dir, so its name is the
 * single target of that framework's type its own file declares (a deployed
 * backend staged from `api: { type: 'backend' }` is still the `api` target).
 * The caller passes the framework TYPE it runs, and a name declared with a
 * different type fails loud (see targets.js).
 *
 * "shared" = the file minus its `targets` key. A target entry may override
 * ANY shared key — same agnostic deep merge at every step (see merge.js), so
 * a per-surface Sentry DSN or analytics id is just
 * targets.<name>.monitoring.providers.sentry.dsn.
 * Target-section keys land at the TOP LEVEL of the resolved config
 * (targets.desktop.platforms resolves to config.platforms, for a target NAMED desktop); the merged
 * `targets` map itself is kept on the result purely so enabled-target
 * enumeration survives resolution — settings are never read from it.
 *
 * Secrets hard-fail: raw files are scanned BEFORE any merge — a secret in
 * any target section (requested or not) throws. Schema findings come back
 * as `errors` so callers pick their strictness (audit throws, boot warns).

/**
 * Compose the company+brand+local layers into ONE self-contained config file for
 * a target's deploy upload (friction #31). The runtime's brand walk-up dies at
 * the upload boundary — `firebase deploy` ships only the functions folder —
 * so the staged file must carry the layers above it itself. The target's full
 * interleave (company shared ← company targets[target] ← brand shared ← brand
 * targets[target] ← local shared ← local targets[target]) is frozen into the
 * shared namespace: the deployed
 * runtime's own `deepMerge(defaults, shared, targets[name])` then yields
 * EXACTLY the local resolution. `targets` keeps presence-and-type keys
 * (presence = enabled, and the `type` every entry must declare; every other
 * value is already folded in, so nothing re-applies above the frozen
 * interleave: a raw merged targets map would let a brand-target value beat a
 * local-shared one, flipping the chain).
 * Framework defaults are NOT baked in: the deployed runtime applies its
 * own, so defaults evolve with the shipped package, not the deploy moment.
 *
 * Environment overlays (#856) compose only for an environment the CALLER named:
 * a compose is a BUILD-time op over the authored layers, and the environment an
 * artifact is FOR is the LANE's answer, never the composing machine's (`omega
 * deploy` from a terminal resolves `development`, which would bake a
 * development override into a production upload). So the ambient answer is
 * never read here, and a compose told nothing freezes the base layers alone.
 * The knob is the one stageFunctions() already takes for the `.env` overlay
 * beside it, spelled the same: `options.environment`.
 *
 * The local-layer file is OPTIONAL inside a brand monorepo (same rule as
 * loadConfig since cp121c): a target with no omega.json5 of its own composes
 * from the brand file alone. Standalone projects still require their file.
 *
 * @param {string} projectDir - Target root or one of its TARGET_SUBDIRS (functions/, dist/).
 * @param {string} target - Canonical target the upload serves ('backend').
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {string} [options.environment] - The environment the upload is FOR (one
 *   of ENV_ENVIRONMENTS): which `omega.<environment>.json5` overlay is frozen
 *   into the composed file. Omitted = no overlay at all.
 * @returns {{ config: object, files: { local: string|null, brand: string|null, company: string|null } }}
 *   `files.brand` null = no brand layer above the target (already self-contained);
 *   `files.local` null = the target rides the brand file alone; `files.company`
 *   null = the brand names no company with a tree on this machine.
