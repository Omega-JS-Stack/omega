/**
 * Canonical schema for config/omega.json5 — pure data, no logic.
 *
 * Entry format is electron-manager's proven src/config/schema.js shape:
 *
 *   {
 *     path:        'brand.id',            // dot-path into the RESOLVED config
 *     type:        'string' | 'boolean' | 'number' | 'integer' | 'array' | 'object',
 *     required:    true | false | (config) => bool,
 *     min:         Number,                // only checked when value present + number
 *     max:         Number,                // only checked when value present + number
 *     match:       RegExp,                // only checked when value present + string
 *     enum:        [...],                 // only checked when value present
 *     itemEnum:    [...],                 // an ARRAY value's allowed members
 *     default:     <value>,               // the framework answer — see below
 *     description: 'What the field drives.',
 *   }
 *
 * configSections() below derives the per-target list of top-level sections
 * this schema declares ([#607](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/607)):
 * a page's frontmatter overrides config keys under a `config:` parent, and
 * that list is BOTH halves of the rule — a section restated bare is a build
 * error, and a key under `config:` that is not a section is one too. Page
 * machinery (`meta`, `schema`, `layout`, `permalink`) is not config and has
 * no home here: `meta` in particular lives in page frontmatter alone, its
 * site-wide default being brand.name / brand.description (the head's
 * fallback), so the config section it briefly had is registered RETIRED.
 *
 * `default:` is the ONE home of every config default
 * ([#478](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/478)): defaults.js
 * builds the merge chain's LOWEST layer from these entries, and the manage
 * walk materializes any missing block into the brand's omega.json5 with this
 * description as its guiding comment. A key with no sane framework answer —
 * owner decisions, tri-states that mean "ask", ids the services provision,
 * anything secret-shaped — carries NO `default:` and is never materialized.
 *
 * `materialize: false` is the one exception to that second sentence
 * ([#793](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/793)): the rule's
 * `default:` still resolves (every reader sees it) but is never WRITTEN into a
 * brand file. It is for framework facts a brand may override and rarely does —
 * presentation the framework owns, like the packaged connection cards — where a
 * copy in every brand config would drift from the framework it came from.
 *
 * The other standing exclusion is the PRESENCE GATE (#425), which means the
 * sections a service reads presence from: `monitoring.providers.sentry` is the
 * brand's pick of Sentry, so those SDK knobs carry NO default and keep their
 * home in @omega.js/monitoring, and `advertising` is the brand's pick of ads
 * (#527 — the adsense `client` id is the ONE switch, and a materialized
 * advertising block would switch the web build's automatic vert placements on
 * for a brand that configured none). Blocks whose services gate on `enabled`
 * instead (cloudflare, searchConsole, slapform, chatsy, replyify)
 * DO carry the default that states the polarity (`enabled: true`, read
 * `!== false`), because presence there picks nothing. Role-level switches
 * beside any providers block (`monitoring.enabled`,
 * `marketing.campaigns.enabled`) always may. The gating doctrine those three
 * cases come from lives in docs/shared/config.md.
 *
 * Rules run against the RESOLVED config for a target — target-section keys
 * are overlaid at the top level by loadConfig() (targets.desktop.platforms
 * validates as `platforms`), which is also how any shared key inside a
 * target entry overrides the shared value.
 *
 * SHARED_SCHEMA always applies; TARGET_SCHEMAS[target] adds that target's
 * refinements. Sections grow as each framework adopts dual-read — seed
 * entries come from EM's schema (desktop) and the sandbox brand's real @omega.js/backend
 * config (backend), never from guesses.
