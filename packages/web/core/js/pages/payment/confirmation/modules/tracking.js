// The confirmation page's conversion PIXEL — the browser half of the checkout
// ([#386](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/386)).
//
// The backend's payment webhook is the TRUTH: it sees what the provider actually
// charged. What only a browser can give is the RETARGETING signal — Meta's and
// TikTok's pixels tie the conversion to the ad click sitting in this page's
// cookies — and, for GA4, the session, the campaign and the client id a webhook
// has none of.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS HALF GETS RIGHT, both found on 2026-08-27:
//
//  1. A TRIAL CHECKOUT IS NOT A PURCHASE
//     ([#654](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/654)). The intent
//     route sets `?track=true` for EVERY checkout, trials included, so a $0 trial
//     used to fire a browser `purchase` while the webhook fired `trial_start`.
//     The AMOUNT was never the defect — the intent route already puts `amount=0`
//     on a trial confirmation URL (`routes/payments/intent/post.js`) — the NAME
//     was: two different event names never deduplicate, so each platform counted
//     the browser half as a second conversion beside the server's trial. A trial
//     order fires `trial_start` with value 0; everything else fires `purchase`.
//  2. GA4 BELONGS ON THE PURCHASE HALF
//     ([#656](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/656)). GA4
//     deduplicates `purchase` on `transaction_id`
//     (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12313109), and both halves
//     send the ORDER id — so the browser adds its attribution and GA4 still
//     counts one purchase. `trial_start` is a GA4 CUSTOM event with no such
//     dedupe, so its browser half names the ad platforms only and the server
//     keeps GA4 to itself.
//
// Both halves carry the SAME dedupe id, or each platform counts two conversions:
//
//   THE DEDUPE ID IS `<canonical>.<order id>`
//
// which is the ORDER-ID branch of the backend's own derivation
// (`events/firestore/payments-webhooks/analytics.js` resolveEventId keys the two
// browser-twinned events, `purchase` and `trial_start`, on the order — the only
// id a browser can compute).

// Build the canonical items array for the purchase.
//
// The category comes from WHAT WAS BOUGHT, and the redirect the intent route
// builds now says so outright — `type=subscription|one-time`, the one field here
// that needs no inferring ([#668](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/668)).
// The cadence is the FALLBACK, for a confirmation URL minted before the type was
// sent: reading the truthiness of the frequency string called every one-time buy a
// subscription, because checkout sends `frequency=once` for one (#282 is the same
// bug in the receipt copy), so the fallback reads FREQUENCIES — the cadences
// checkout actually SELLS, the same list the bindings and the verification poll
// read. A stale link that carries a cadence for a one-time product (the live buy
// reached this file as `frequency=annually`) is classified by the type regardless.
//
// `price` is the conversion's own amount, passed in rather than read off the
// state: the intent route already sends `amount=0` on a trial checkout, so this
// default and the trial's explicit 0 agree today. DEFENSIVE — the conversion's
// value has ONE source in this file, so a confirmation URL that ever carried the
// plan's price on a trial could not put it on the item either ([#654]).
