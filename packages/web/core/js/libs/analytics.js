/**
 * The web host of the analytics facade — the ONE way a page counts anything
 * ([#328](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/328), stage E).
 *
 * `@omega.js/analytics` owns the catalog, the per-provider adapters and the
 * guarded browser transport ([docs/shared/analytics.md](../../../../../docs/shared/analytics.md)).
 * What lives HERE is the part only a page can supply — the host's three seams:
 *
 *   transport  the package's browser transport: the page's own gtag/fbq/ttq,
 *              each guarded, so a blocked provider is a silent no-op (#306)
 *   consent    the banner's record (`libs/tracking-consent.js`), read LIVE, so
 *              a visitor who accepts mid-session is counted from that moment
 *   context    the captured attribution (#384) flattened into what the adapters
 *              read, plus `runtime: 'web'`
 *
 * `environment` is NOT set here: @omega.js/client injects it at init from the
 * brand's own `config.environment`, which is the one seam that knows.
 *
 * The package is reached through @omega.js/client, never as a bare specifier:
 * `@omega.js/analytics` is private and never publishes, so it exists in a
 * consumer install only as the copy vendored into the client's dist — and the
 * client is a real runtime dependency of every framework (HARD RULE 3).
 *
 * Call sites speak CANONICAL and nothing else:
 *
 *   event('add_to_cart', { currency: 'USD', value: 19, items: [...] });
 *
 * The old guarded wrappers (trackGoogle/trackMeta/trackTikTok) are gone with
 * the rewire: a call site that names a provider is a call site that can drift
 * from the catalog.
 *
 * IDENTITY is the one thing that is not an event — it has no catalog entry
 * because it is a setting the events after it inherit — so it stays here, in
 * the one module already allowed to name the page globals, guarded the same way.
 * GA4's `user_id` is the exception: @omega.js/client owns that one key on every
 * runtime, so nothing below writes it (see `identify()`).

/**
 * The pixels' half of the identity: every match key SHA-256, and `external_id`

 *
 * The hashing rules are the shared package's (`@omega.js/analytics/identity`),
 * not this file's, so a normalization rule has one home to change. They are PER
 * PROVIDER on purpose: Meta's advanced matching hashes a phone as bare digits,
 * TikTok's pixel hashes E.164 — the same number, two digests, and sending either
 * one's key to the other matches nobody.
 *
 * Against the SERVER's match data (@omega.js/backend's
 * `libraries/analytics/match-data.js`) every digest agrees exactly: the email
 * always did, and the phone converged when the server took each platform's own
 * normalization ([#392](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/392)).
 *
 * `external_id` is per provider too, verified against the live specs
 * ([#410](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/410)). TikTok's Events
 * API REQUIRES it hashed, so this half hashes the same uid the same way the
 * server does and the two still meet. Meta only RECOMMENDS hashing and its own
 * Pixel example passes a bare id, so Meta keeps the raw uid — which is not a
 * leak: it is Meta's own key, matched on their side, and it is the exact string
 * the server sends as `identity.externalId`.
 *
 * Consent needs no gate here: a pixel exists on the page only after a marketing
 * grant loaded it (`core/js/core/analytics-loader.js`), so the `typeof` guards
 * below already carry the visitor's answer.
 *
 * @param {string} userId - The raw uid.

 * @param {string} [phone] - Auth's `phoneNumber` (E.164), when the account has one.
