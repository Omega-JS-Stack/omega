/**
 * `omega deploy` — the explicit publish verb (D13: commits never
 * auto-publish). Delivers the brand to its repo and dispatches the scaffolded
 * build workflow so CI runs the SAME build and publishes to gh-pages.
 *
 * ONE lane, the same one every target takes
 * ([#872](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/872),
 * [#915](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/915)): the executor
 * resolves it from the brand (`@omega.js/devkit/deploy`'s resolveDeployLane),
 * packs any local frameworks and force-pushes a SNAPSHOT of the brand folder to
 * `omega-deploy`, the one branch CI ever builds. Then it waits for the workflow
 * and dispatches. A linked tree no longer switches itself to the direct lane;
 * `--direct` is how a human asks for that.
 *
 * Every run starts with the local scaffold the retired `omega setup` used to
 * own (ensureTarget) and its NETWORK half as a precheck: the brand's .env keys
 * are published as repo secrets so CI has what the scaffolded workflow asks
 * for. `--no-secrets` opts out.
 *
 * Flags: --dry-run (print the exact dispatch, send nothing; skips the push),
 * --local (production build only: no push, no dispatch),
 * --direct (build + push dist straight to the WEBSITE repo's gh-pages, the
 * `<brand.id>-<target name>` repo of #883: the lane the scaffolded CI workflow
 * runs too, and the no-CI path for any brand whose repo has no workflows yet;
 * CI dispatch stays the default verb).
