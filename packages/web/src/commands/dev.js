/**
 * `omega dev` — the development loop:
 *   1. dev-mode assets (stable un-hashed names, no minify) → .omega/manifest
 *   2. programmatic Eleventy watch + serve over src/
 *   3. asset-source watchers (consumer src/assets + packaged theme/core
 *      layers) rebuild bundles IN PLACE — URLs are stable in dev, so the
 *      rendered HTML stays valid without a re-render; the dev server
 *      watches the built asset trees and live-reloads the browser (css
 *      hot-swaps, js reloads — no hand refresh).
 *
 * Port (N7): the website convention is 4000, resolved through the allocator —
 * taken ports bump +1. Multi-instance web brands offset deterministically:
 * each instance wants 4000 + its position in the instances array, so
 * apps/website and apps/website-admin dev side-by-side. `omega dev
 * --port=4001` (or a config `ports.website` entry) PINS the port instead:
 * busy = hard error, never a silent bump. The
 * resolved map of a live sibling backend (its `.temp/ports.json`) plus this
 * website port and its resolved ORIGIN (protocol included,
 * [#262](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/262)) are injected into
 * the page chrome as `dev` so
 * @omega.js/client connects to the stack that is ACTUALLY running — read PER
 * RESPONSE (the render-time bake is advisory, rewritten as the page is served,
 * [#346](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/346)) and per request
 * for the auth-emulator proxy, because a backend that boots after this server
 * (or restarts onto bumped ports) is the normal case
 * ([#300](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/300)).
 *
 * `omega dev --local` first links every @omega.js framework the brand uses to
 * the local Omega monorepo (file: installs, idempotent) and starts the
 * monorepo's src→dist watch, then runs the normal dev loop (master plan §8).

 * Force a config RESET on edits under the template-source dirs (#49). Both

 * time) and the json-in-_includes data system (read into site.data._includes
 * at config time) are CAPTURES — and Eleventy reuses one config across watch
 * rebuilds unless the changed file triggers a reset, so without this the
 * rebuild logs "Wrote N files" and re-renders the stale capture until the
 * server is restarted.
 *
 * The targets are DERIVED, never listed (#200): `configureOmega` reads every
 * config-time input through the captured-read helper (@omega.js/devkit/reads), which
 * records the directory of each read — the union IS the set of dirs the
 * capture depends on, so a capture added to the engine later registers itself.
 * A hand list could only ever be the set someone remembered (#139).
 *
 * Ordering: Eleventy runs this before `configureOmega` in the same config
 * callback, so it ARMS the registration instead of doing it — the recorded
 * union only exists once the engine's capture scope closes, which happens on
 * the way out of `configureOmega`, still inside this callback and long before
 * Eleventy reads its watch targets.
 *
 * What lands in the union: each layer's machinery dirs (`_layouts`,
 * `_includes`, `_sections`, `_components`, a theme's `fonts/`), the packaged
 * `defaults` tree (#136), and the layer roots the theme chain PROBES — a
 * consumer-local `src/themes/<id>` included, so an scss edit inside a brand's
 * own theme rides BOTH lanes: the asset watcher's rebuild AND a config reset
 * (the same accepted cost the `_sections` dirs already pay, #138).
 *
 * Packaged targets register REAL paths (the helper realpaths anything outside
 * the consumer dir). A linked brand reaches the framework through a
 * `node_modules/@omega.js/web` symlink, and Eleventy's watcher ignores
 * everything under `node_modules` — the resolved path sidesteps it.
 *
 * BOTH path forms are registered for cwd-contained targets. The absolute form
 * alone carries the reset today (the dev loop hands Eleventy absolute dirs, so
 * the watcher's event arrives absolute and matches it). Registering the
 * relative form ADDS a second, relative event for the same edit — each event
 * decides the reset for itself and the last one wins the throttle, which is
 * why the relative form must never be registered ALONE — and is kept as
 * insurance so a reset still fires if Eleventy ever reports these edits in
 * relative form. Its observable cost is a duplicate "File changed" line per
 * save. A target OUTSIDE cwd (a linked brand's framework layers, a hoisted
 * node_modules) registers ONLY absolute: an escaping `../` watch target makes
 * Eleventy re-root its watcher to the common ancestor, after which NO event
 * path matches ANY registered target and every reset dies — including the
 * consumer ones (#134 verification).
 *
 * Dropping the relative form was TRIED and reverted (#344). It is not dead
 * insurance: with only the absolute form registered, the packaged-layer reset
 * starves — an interleaved A/B of dev-watch.test.js, one run per arm per
 * round, went 0/8 red on both forms and 5/8 red on absolute-only. The extra
 * registrations change how chokidar arranges its FSEvents streams (its
 * consolidation threshold is a count of watched paths under one parent), and
 * the arrangement the duplicates produce is the one that reliably delivers a
 * freshly created packaged tmp dir's events. Measure before touching this.
 *
 * ONLY the reset union lands here. The same scope also records the RESCAN
 * union (#200 Lane B) — the content scans, whose dirs must never carry a reset
 * — and `options.onRescans` hands it to the lane that owns it
 * (watchRescanTargets below).

/**
 * Serve the Firebase auth emulator THROUGH the site origin (#156) — the dev
 * counterpart of the self-hosted /__/auth/* helpers a production build ships
 * (src/firebase-auth-helpers.js).
 *
 * The emulator's OAuth handler hands a redirect credential back by writing
 * `firebase:redirectEvent:*` into sessionStorage on ITS OWN origin, and the
 * SDK's helper iframe reads it back from there. Served on the emulator's port,
 * that origin is a third party to the site, and browser storage partitioning
 * gives the iframe a different, empty partition — the return leg dead-ends.
 * Proxied here, handler and iframe are both first-party to the site, so they
 * share one partition and signInWithRedirect completes in dev exactly as it
 * does in production.
 *
 * The prefixes are the emulator's whole surface, mounted at the site ROOT
 * because connectAuthEmulator() discards any path on the URL it is given
 * (@firebase/auth: "Always replace path with /") — a sub-path mount is not
 * available to us. `/emulator/*` covers the handler, the helper iframe and the
 * out-of-band action links; the two googleapis.com prefixes are the REST
 * surface, which the SDK addresses as `<emulator origin>/<apiHost><path>`.
 * None of them can collide with a page URL.
 *
 * The target port is resolved PER REQUEST (#300). With the proxy on, this —
 * not the baked `dev.ports` — is where every auth call actually goes, so a
 * boot-time number kept sending sign-ins to whatever emulator held the
 * classic 9099 (a neighbouring project's, in the report) long after this
 * brand's suite came up bumped.
 * @param {number|function} [authPort] - the port, or a getter for the live one
