/**
 * Failed payment webhook retry cron job
 *
 * The webhook route answers the processor 200 the moment the event is stored, so a
 * doc the onWrite trigger marked `failed` is never delivered again: a transient fault
 * (a processor API blip, a lost Firestore write) drops the payment silently.
 *
 * This flips those docs back to `pending`, which is exactly what the trigger picks
 * up. Reprocessing is safe — the trigger's staleness guard and its previously-completed
 * guard make a second pass a no-op rather than a second charge or a second email.
 *
 * At the ceiling the doc is dead-lettered ONCE, loudly, and left alone: something
 * permanent is wrong with it and it needs a human, not another pass.
