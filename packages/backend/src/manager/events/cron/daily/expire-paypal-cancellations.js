/**
 * Expire PayPal pending cancellations
 *
 * PayPal has no cancel_at_period_end like Stripe — cancellation is immediate on PayPal's side.
 * @omega.js/backend keeps users active with cancellation.pending=true until the billing period ends.
 * Since PayPal does NOT fire a webhook at period end, this cron job transitions those
 * users to 'cancelled' status once their paid period has expired.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. Query users with PayPal subscriptions where cancellation.pending=true
 * 2. Check if subscription.expires.timestampUNIX < now
 * 3. Re-read the user + order, and skip anything a newer webhook has since written
 * 4. Update status to 'cancelled' and cancellation.pending to false — on the user doc
 *    AND on payments-orders/{orderId}, whose `unified` mirror is what handlers and the
 *    UI read; the two land together in one batch
 * 5. Dispatch 'subscription-cancelled' transition (sends email)
 *
 * The staleness discipline is the webhook trigger's: the batch below is read once and
 * written to one user at a time, so a webhook may land between the read and the write.
 * Anything stamped after this run's read time is the newer truth, and the cron stands
 * down rather than overwriting it ([#221]).
