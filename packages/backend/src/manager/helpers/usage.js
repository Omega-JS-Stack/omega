/**
 * Usage — the counted-feature gate
 * ([#647](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/647)).
 *
 * ONE call does the whole job:
 *
 *   const left = await ctx.usage.consume('saves');   // throws a 429 over limit
 *
 * `consume` checks both counters, refuses with a 429 that names WHICH one hit,
 * else counts, writes, and returns what is left. There is no separate
 * "validate then increment then update" dance for a caller to get half right —
 * every hand-rolled gate in the framework's own routes existed because there
 * was one.
 *
 * What a feature IS lives in config, once: the top-level `features` catalog
 * defines it (name, icon, definition, and the `usage` block that meters it)
 * and each product names only its VALUE. @omega.js/account's features module
 * owns every derivation from those two halves plus the user's counters — the
 * effective limit (a per-user override wins over the plan's number), the day
 * share, what is left — so this gate and the browser's account page can never
 * speak different numbers.
 *
 * Two counters per counted feature per user, month and day. The day's share is
 * the month limit spread over the days of this month, so a quota cannot be
 * burned on day one; `usage: { pace: false }` on the catalog entry opts out.
 * Either counter full refuses, and the month cap always holds.
 *
 * Init is LAZY: the middleware `attach`es a counter that resolves the account
 * on the first consume/read, so a route that never counts pays nothing.
 *
 * Anonymous counting is EXPLICIT: `ctx.usage.forKey(ip)` returns a separate
 * keyed counter. Passing a key can never silently move a signed-in user's
 * counters into the anonymous store, which is what the old `options.key` did.
 *
 * Mirrors are declared in the CATALOG (`usage: { mirror: ['teams'] }`), never
 * at the call site: `consume` writes the touched feature's counters — that
 * feature's, not the whole usage object — to the user doc and to every doc the
 * account owns of each named kind (`owns.teams`), in one parallel write.
