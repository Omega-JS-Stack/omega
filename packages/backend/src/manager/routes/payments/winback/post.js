/**
 * POST /payments/winback
 * Applies the cancel-flow SAVE OFFER to the authenticated user's live
 * subscription, so the cancel they started never happens
 * ([#268](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/268)).
 *
 * The offer is the brand's (`payment.winback` in omega.json5 — 50% off the next
 * cycle by default) and it reaches the provider as a discount, through the same
 * coupon plumbing a checkout discount code rides. The subscription itself does
 * not change: the customer keeps the plan, the cadence and the renewal date they
 * already had, and the next invoice is the only thing that moves — so the only
 * thing this route writes onto the account is the discount itself
 * (`subscription.discount`, [#325]), never the plan, the cadence or the renewal.
 *
 * Claimed ONCE per subscription: the claim is recorded on
 * payments-orders/{orderId}.requests.winback, which is also what a second call
 * is refused against (`offer-already-claimed`) — an offer that could be taken
 * every time the cancel dialog opens is a permanent discount nobody agreed to.
 * A subscription with no order doc has nowhere to record it, so it is refused
 * (`offer-not-claimable`) rather than handed an offer with no memory.
 *
 * Cross-provider and CAPABILITY-GATED, the same shape uncancel uses: a provider
 * that can discount a live subscription exports applyOffer(), one that cannot
 * simply lacks the export, and the route refuses before dispatch rather than
 * letting the caller discover it as a provider error
 * ([#212](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/212)).
 *
 * EVERY refusal here carries a machine-readable code on the response properties
 * (`additional.code`), not just the capability gate's
 * ([#311](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/311)): the client
 * pitches the offer off the ACCOUNT alone, so a state it cannot see — an
 * admin-granted subscription with no provider details, a brand that turned the
 * offer off since the page loaded — reaches accept, and a refusal it cannot name
 * leaves the customer in a dialog arming a retry that can never succeed. The
 * codes, in the order they are refused: `confirmation-required`,
 * `offer-disabled`, `no-active-subscription`, `trial-not-eligible`,
 * `cancellation-pending`, `missing-payment-details`, `unknown-provider`,
 * `not-supported-by-provider`, `offer-not-claimable`, `offer-already-claimed`.
 * All but the first are dead ends for that account: the billing card retires the
 * offer on them and opens the questionnaire the customer came for.
 * Requires authentication.
