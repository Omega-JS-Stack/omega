/**
 * The machine-wide orphan reap every emulator boot runs before it claims a port
 * ([#781](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/781)).
 *
 * Emulator processes outlive the run that started them whenever the parent is
 * killed by pid, force-killed, or torn down with its shell: firebase-tools puts
 * each emulator in its own process group, so the survivors reparent to PID 1
 * and hold memory and ports until somebody notices. Found on a real machine:
 * ~100 `functionsEmulatorRuntime` workers from a node version that machine no
 * longer runs, plus a hub on a BUMPED port with three java jars, parent gone
 * for hours.
 *
 * The two reapers this file joins could reach none of it. The port-driven one
 * only ever looked at the ports THIS run wants, and the record-driven one only
 * at pids a record still names — a hub on 4402 belonging to a legacy run is
 * outside both by construction.
 *
 * **The verdict is parentage AND a strict family match, both required, and no
 * ownership proof at all.** An orphan of the emulator family is NOBODY's: it is
 * reaped whatever project it names (Ian 2026-09-03, docs/shared/rulings.md),
 * which supersedes the [#293](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/293)
 * line that another brand's orphans stay. The #293 lesson survives as the
 * FAMILY half: a name matching `/emulator|firebase/i` killed another session's
 * reload watcher, so nothing here matches on a name, on a port, or on the words
 * `node`, `java`, `firebase` or `firebase-functions` alone — only on the exact
 * command shapes below: the hub, the functions runtime worker, the functions
 * discovery server, an emulator jar out of the firebase cache, and puppeteer's
 * headless browser.
 *
 * Everything the sweep reads or does goes through a seam, so its verdicts are
 * testable against real `ps` rows without a single live process.
