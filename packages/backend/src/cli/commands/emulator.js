   * Pre-boot reap of a STALE pid record: the leftovers of a previous run that
   * died without teardown, taken BY PID, before this boot overwrites the file
   * that names them ([#721](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/721)).
   *
   * The sibling sweep above only ever considers an ORPHAN, so it cannot reach a
   * dead run's member that still hangs off another member of that same dead run
   * — the reload watcher's usual shape while its root is unwinding — and
   * writeEmulatorPidRecord drops the previous record the moment a new root pid
   * appears. Between the two, a dead boot's nodemon survived every stop path
   * this framework has, forever.
   *
   * STALE is the first proof: the record's ROOT pid is gone, so the run that
   * wrote it is not around to own its own processes. A live root means a LIVE
   * record — this boot is a second stack beside a running one — and nothing in
   * it is anyone's to reap. A record that names no usable root at all proves
   * neither, and an unprovable root is not a kill order.
   *
   * IDENTITY is the second, and it is the whole safety story. A record is a
   * list of NUMBERS, the OS recycles numbers, and the run that could vouch for
   * them is by definition gone. So nothing is signalled on the number: the LIVE
   * row must still read as emulator machinery of this project AND hang off the
   * dead run itself (isReapableRecordedProcess). A pid whose row cannot be read
   * has no identity to prove and is never signalled. The escalation re-proves
   * it, because the grace window is long enough for a number to be freed and
   * handed out again — and there is no apologising to a SIGKILL.
