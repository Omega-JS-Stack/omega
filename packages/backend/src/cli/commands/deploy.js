/**
 * `omega deploy`: the explicit publish verb, on the ONE lane every target
 * takes ([#872](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/872)).
 *
 * The DEFAULT is a dispatch of the brand's composed backend workflow: the
 * executor delivers the brand to its repo (packed + snapshot-pushed when the
 * brand is nested or linked, committed + pushed when it is neither), waits for
 * the workflow, and dispatches it. The runner then runs THIS verb with
 * `--direct`, which is the whole local behavior: license verdict, stage,
 * local-package staging, `firebase deploy`, public-invoker IAM.
 *
 * The precheck is the sibling frameworks' (#675): the target's composed .env
 * keys are published as repo Actions secrets, because the runner has no .env
 * of its own to read. `--no-secrets` opts out.
