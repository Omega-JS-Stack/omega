/**
 * Test: a missing user doc heals at sign-in
 * ([#405](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/405)).
 *
 * A user doc is born at signup. Nothing recreated it when it went missing, so an
 * auth user whose `users/{uid}` disappeared stayed unauthenticated on every
 * request forever. The heal sits in authenticate()'s token lane — the one seam
 * every signed-in surface passes through — and recreates the doc auth:on-create
 * would have written, behind the auth record and nothing else.
 *
 * Real everything: real Firebase Auth users in the emulator, real ID tokens
 * (custom token → the emulator's own identitytoolkit endpoint, exactly how a
 * browser gets one), the real Context, the real on-create and before-signin
 * handlers, and the real HTTP surface for the wiring. Broken states are BUILT
 * here — an established account whose doc is deleted — because that is the state
 * the wild produces, and the accounts are IMPORTED so their creationTime is a
 * real one the signup window can be tested on both sides of.
 *
 * Run: npx omega test framework:helpers/user-doc-heal
