/**
 * Test: POST /payments/webhook — Stripe renewals reach the pipeline
 * ([#212](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/212)).
 *
 * A subscription renewal produces NO state transition — active → active, same
 * product — so the invoice event is the only signal that money moved. Stripe's
 * webhook provider listed `invoice.payment_failed` but not
 * `invoice.payment_succeeded`, so every renewal was dropped at the door as an
 * unsupported event type and Stripe recurring revenue never reached analytics
 * (whose `isPaymentEvent()` had been expecting that exact string all along).
 *
 * The proof runs at both ends of the door: the parser's own mapping of a real
 * invoice payload, and the route accepting the delivery and landing the pipeline
 * doc it is supposed to land.
 *
 * `invoice.paid` stays OUT by design — Stripe fires it for the same paid invoice
 * and the analytics resolver has no per-invoice dedup, so ingesting both would
 * report a renewal's revenue twice. That exclusion is asserted here so it cannot
 * be added back by accident.
 *
 * Run: npx omega test backend:routes/payments/webhook-stripe-invoice
