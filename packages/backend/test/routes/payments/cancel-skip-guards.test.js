/**
 * Test: POST /payments/cancel — `skipGuards` is a privileged request
 * ([#212](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/212)).
 *
 * `skipGuards` arrives in the request BODY, so any client can send it. It waives
 * the 24-hour subscription-age guard, which exists to stop a cancellation racing
 * a checkout that is still settling — a guard a caller must not be able to waive
 * for itself. The route honors it for an admin, or anywhere outside a real
 * deployment (the suites and the dev palette cancel seeded subscriptions minutes
 * old), and ignores it with a warning otherwise.
 *
 * The whole matrix therefore has to be driven in a PRODUCTION environment: in a
 * testing run every caller is permitted by design, so a testing-run assertion
 * would prove nothing. getEnvironment() reads the env live, so swapping it is
 * the real switch — the same technique webhook-test-provider.test.js uses.
 *
 * Both verdicts land as a 400 with DIFFERENT text: the age rejection means the
 * guard ran, and "Unknown provider" means the request got past it (the persona
 * carries a deliberately unknown provider so nothing external is ever reached).
 *
 * Run: npx omega test backend:routes/payments/cancel-skip-guards
