/**
 * Test: POST /payments/winback — the cancel-flow save offer's apply path
 * ([#268](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/268)).
 *
 * The offer is pitched before the cancellation questionnaire and accepting it
 * discounts the next cycle instead of ending the subscription. What that offer
 * IS belongs to the brand (`payment.winback`, resolved by @omega.js/config with a
 * 50%-off default), so this suite reads the brand's own resolution rather than
 * asserting a number.
 *
 * Two layers, the same split cancel.test.js and plan.test.js use:
 *  - the wire guards and the happy path over `http.as(...)`, which is what
 *    proves the route is registered, auth-gated and schema-validated at all;
 *  - the per-subscription guards and the provider capability gate through
 *    DIRECT handler calls (the _route-harness technique), so one test can choose
 *    a provider and a subscription shape without minting a persona each.
 *
 * The offer is claimed ONCE: the claim lives on
 * payments-orders/{orderId}.requests.winback, so the second call is refused
 * against the same document the first one wrote.
 *
 * EVERY refusal carries a branchable code on `omega-properties`
 * ([#311](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/311)): the client
 * pitches the offer off the account alone, so any refusal it cannot name leaves
 * the customer in a dialog arming a retry that can never succeed. Each guard
 * below asserts its own code for that reason.
 *
 * Run: npx omega test framework:routes/payments/winback
