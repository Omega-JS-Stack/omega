/**
 * Test: the test intent provider applies a validated discount to the amounts
 *
 * The route validates the code and records it, and the Stripe provider hands it
 * to Stripe as a coupon — Stripe then does the math on its own checkout page. The
 * test provider has no such page, so a discounted checkout moved no number a
 * human could see: the confirmation URL still quoted the full price
 * ([#239](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/239)).
 *
 * Each case calls the handler DIRECTLY through the shared route harness, as its
 * OWN seeded persona (`intent-discount-<case>`, declared in the seed roster —
 * #406): every case buys a subscription, so one account per case is what keeps
 * the checkout guard from rejecting the next one. Everything
 * downstream — the provider, the auto-fired webhook, the webhook route, the
 * on-write trigger — is the real pipeline.
 *
 * Product-agnostic: resolves the first paid product from config.payment.products.
 *
 * Run: npx omega test framework:routes/payments/intent-discount-amounts
