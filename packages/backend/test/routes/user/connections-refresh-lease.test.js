/**
 * Test: routes/user/connections — the refresh lease
 * ([#783](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/783)).
 *
 * Run (from the framework repo): npm test routes/user/connections-refresh-lease
 *
 * A backend never runs as ONE process. Two instances refreshing the same user's
 * same provider at once spend a one-time refresh token twice (Twitch rotates its
 * own on every use): the loser's exchange is refused, and the token it writes
 * back is dead. Nothing serialized them — no in-flight map could, since the
 * other refresh is in another process. What does is a LEASE on the record,
 * taken in a Firestore transaction.
 *
 * What this pins:
 *
 *   1. the transaction decides: an absent lease and a lease older than 30
 *      seconds are both WON; a fresh one is LOST, with nothing written;
 *   2. a winner runs the provider once, stores the token and removes the lease
 *      in the same write — and a FAILING winner removes it too, so a crash never
 *      wedges the record past the expiry;
 *   3. a loser never touches the provider: it waits for the stored token and
 *      answers it, or answers 409 naming the stalled refresh and writes nothing;
 *   4. both paths answer `{ success: true, token }`.
 *
 * Everything is offline. The offline lane has no Firestore, so the seam is the
 * `admin` handle the route already takes: an in-memory store that applies a
 * `set(..., { merge: true })` the way Firestore does (deep merge, and
 * `FieldValue.delete()` removes the key) and answers a transaction from the same
 * documents. No emulator, no network, no provider.
