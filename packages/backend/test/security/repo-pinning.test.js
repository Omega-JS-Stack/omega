/**
 * Test: admin post/repo routes never take the target repo from the caller (wave-2 B4)
 *
 * The GitHub owner/repo is always derived from brand config. Caller-supplied
 * `githubUser`/`githubRepo` were removed from the schemas, so they cannot reach
 * a handler even if a client still sends them — a blogger-role account must not
 * be able to redirect a commit at another repo the shared token can write.
 *
 * Schemas are pure functions with no I/O, so they are asserted directly.
