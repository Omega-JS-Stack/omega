/**
 * Test: auth:on-create fires NO conversion
 * ([#577](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/577), which moved the
 * server half of `sign_up` off this trigger).
 *
 * The trigger used to fire it ([#385](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/385) §4),
 * and it fired blind: an auth trigger has no HTTP request behind it, so the
 * registration reached Meta and TikTok with no IP, no user agent, no platform
 * cookies and an attribution the browser had not posted yet. It now fires from
 * the post-auth request that carries all four (`routes/user/signup`, covered by
 * analytics/signup-conversion.test.js).
 *
 * Which makes THIS file's job the other half of that decision: the trigger must
 * stay silent. Two fires with one dedupe id is one registration counted twice on
 * platforms that merge them and two on the one that does not, so a well-meaning
 * re-add here is exactly the regression worth a test.
 *
 * Real handler, real Manager, real ctx, real Firestore write. The record handed
 * in is a UserRecord shape for a uid that has no doc yet — the branch a genuine
 * new account takes. No Auth user is created, so the emulator's own trigger
 * never races this one; the doc it writes is deleted afterwards.
 *
 * Run: npx omega test framework:events/auth-signup-conversion
