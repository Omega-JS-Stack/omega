/**
 * The daily usage reset cron (`events/cron/daily/reset-usage.js`)
 * ([#647](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/647)).
 *
 * The promises, all of them things a user is silently punished by when broken:
 *  - EVERY counter block under `usage` is reset, whatever its key. Catalog
 *    membership is not the test: the framework's own anti-abuse gates count on
 *    the user doc with an explicit limit and carry no catalog entry, so a
 *    catalog-only sweep left them growing forever and the user permanently
 *    refused after five email-preference changes;
 *  - `usage.overrides` is NEVER touched — an admin granted those credits and a
 *    reset is not a revoke;
 *  - the day counter resets every day, the month counter only on the 1st;
 *  - one write per user, however many counters moved.
 *
 * Plain-node unit test (no emulator): the cron's collaborators are the
 * collection walk and the document write, and both are recorded here rather
 * than performed — which is what makes the resulting patch assertable.
