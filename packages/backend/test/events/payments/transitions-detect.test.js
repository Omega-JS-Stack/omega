/**
 * Test: payment transition detection
 * Unit tests for detectSubscriptionTransition() — a pure function over the
 * before/after unified subscription plus the webhook's event type.
 *
 * Covers the two things the event type alone decides:
 *   1. Refund detection, which must know EVERY provider's refund event string
 *      (the strings are pinned against each provider's own webhook parser here,
 *      so a parser that renames one fails this test instead of silently dropping
 *      the customer's refund email)
 *   2. Refund idempotency — a webhook doc that already completed once must not
 *      dispatch payment-refunded (and its email) a second time
 *   3. The one-time side of the same question — detectOneTimeTransition() reads
 *      the event type alone, so EVERY one-time transition needs that same
 *      idempotency guard, not just the refund
 *
 * And the state rules, where ORDER inside the array is the behavior: each rule
 * added here is proved to fire AND proved not to shadow the rule it sits in
 * front of ([#212](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/212)).
