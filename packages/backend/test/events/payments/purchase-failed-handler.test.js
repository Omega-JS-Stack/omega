/**
 * Test: the one-time purchase-failed handler tells the customer their payment
 * failed ([#673](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/673)).
 *
 * The transition IS reachable, which is what decided this: a Stripe
 * `invoice.payment_failed` whose `billing_reason` is not a subscription one
 * parses as category `one-time` (routes/payments/webhook/providers/stripe.js),
 * and `detectOneTimeTransition()` maps that event to `purchase-failed`. The
 * population behind it is a MANUAL invoice that failed — nobody is standing at a
 * checkout watching it, which is the reason its subscription cousin
 * `checkout-declined` deliberately sends nothing — so the failure only reaches
 * the customer if this handler tells them.
 *
 * Called directly, and the email library is RECORDED rather than run, for the
 * same reasons its purchase-refunded twin is.
 *
 * Run: npx omega test backend:events/payments/purchase-failed-handler
