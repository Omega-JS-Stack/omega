/**
 * Test: Payment Journey - Win-back
 * Simulates: fully cancelled paid subscriber → checkout → active again
 *
 * A full cancellation leaves the PAID product id on the user doc (status goes to
 * cancelled, the product does not go back to basic), so the returning subscriber's
 * checkout matched none of the transition rules: no confirmation email, and the
 * analytics resolver read the payment event as a renewal
 * ([#218](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/218)).
 *
 * The caller is this suite's own seeded persona, driven through the shared route
 * harness: the ACCOUNT is declared in the seed roster (#406) and the starting
 * state (a cancelled subscription) is a SHAPE this suite writes onto it, because
 * the seed only makes healthy steady-state accounts. Everything downstream of
 * the handler — the test provider's checkout, the webhook doc, the on-write
 * trigger, the transition detection, the user-doc write — is the real pipeline.
 *
 * Product-agnostic: resolves the first paid product from config.payment.products
 *
 * Run: npx omega test framework:events/payments/journey-payments-winback
