/**
 * Test: a transition is claimed per order, so concurrent webhooks dispatch it once
 *
 * Transition detection is a DIFF — the user's stored subscription against the
 * unified state the event carries — so it is only correct while one webhook is in
 * flight. Stripe sent `customer.subscription.created` and
 * `invoice.payment_succeeded` one second apart for the same checkout: both runs
 * read `users/{uid}` while it still said `basic` (the first run's write landed 11
 * seconds later), both detected `subscription/new-subscription`, and both
 * dispatched it — two order emails to one customer, two `trial_start` fires
 * ([#665](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/665)).
 *
 * The fix is a CLAIM on the order, taken in a transaction before the dispatch:
 * `payments-orders/{orderId}.transitions.<name>`. Per order per transition NAME,
 * so the order's own later transitions — a cancellation, a plan change — still
 * fire; only a second run of the SAME transition on the SAME order is suppressed.
 *
 * Plain-node (no emulator, no network), for the reason the atomic-writes and
 * sweep-staleness suites are: the emulator cannot run two triggers for one order
 * interleaved on demand, and this bug only exists in the interleaving. The shared
 * in-memory stand-in models Firestore's real transaction contract — versioned
 * reads, staged writes, and a re-run of the whole block when a read document
 * changed underneath — so the claim is genuinely contended rather than assumed.
 *
 * A claim gates all THREE things the transition drives — the handler, the analytics
 * fire, and the marketing sync — because the live sighting duplicated all three: two
 * order emails, two `trial_start`s (GA4 counted both), two marketing syncs.
 *
 * Each is counted through the runner's own testing-mode seam: `ctx.isTesting()` is
 * true here, so the pipeline logs `… skipped (testing mode)` at exactly the point it
 * would otherwise email a real customer, post a real conversion, or write to a real
 * marketing list. Those lines ARE the three effects, counted.
