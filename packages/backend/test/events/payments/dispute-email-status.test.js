/**
 * Test: dispute alert email outcome
 *
 * The dispute doc's actions.email is an operator's record of whether the brand was
 * told about a chargeback. It used to be written 'success' unconditionally while the
 * send was fire-and-forget — including when the send never happened at all, because
 * the brand has no contact email configured.
 *
 * sendDisputeEmail() now resolves the outcome the caller records. This proves the
 * skipped outcome, which is the one a config gap produces (an actual send needs
 * TEST_EXTENDED_MODE and a real provider, so the delivered outcomes are not
 * exercised here).
