/**
 * Test: the one-time purchase-refunded handler's record of the refund, and the
 * mail it owes the customer
 * ([#212](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/212),
 * [#673](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/673)).
 *
 * The handler's log line is the operator's record: it used to name the order and
 * nothing else, because on-write.js resolved the provider's refund details for the
 * subscription transition only. The CUSTOMER got nothing at all — the handler was
 * a log-only stub, so somebody refunded on a one-time purchase heard about it from
 * their bank statement. It now sends through the same generator its subscription
 * twin uses (`order` template, `refunded` event).
 *
 * The handler is called directly — the dispatch that calls it is fire-and-forget
 * and skipped in testing mode, so the emulator journey cannot see either.
 *
 * The email library is RECORDED rather than run: it is an external sink (SendGrid),
 * the same treatment the webhook harness gives the Sentry handle.
 *
 * Run: npx omega test backend:events/payments/purchase-refunded-handler
