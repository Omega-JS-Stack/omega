/**
 * Test: every emulator boot reaps the machine's ORPHANED emulator-family
 * processes before it claims a port
 * ([#781](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/781)).
 *
 * Found on a real machine: ~100 `functionsEmulatorRuntime` workers from a
 * legacy node v22 firebase-tools, plus a hub on a bumped port with three java
 * jars, all reparented to PID 1 with their parents gone for hours. Nothing in
 * this framework could see any of it: the port-driven reaper only looked at
 * the ports THIS run wanted and only signalled what it could prove was this
 * project's, and the record-driven reap only reaches pids a record still names.
 *
 * Run: npx omega test backend:cli/emulator-orphans
 *
 * The verdict is pure (a ps row in, a boolean out) and the sweep reads the
 * world through seams, so every case below states a process table and reads
 * back exactly what would have been signalled — nothing real is touched. The
 * rows are copied from `ps -A -o pid=,ppid=,uid=,command=` on the machine that
 * reported this, except the rows marked BUILT below: shapes firebase-tools
 * launches that were not running when the snapshot was taken.
 *
 * The one exception is the real-process drill at the bottom, which spawns its
 * own idle node, orphans it, and runs the REAL sweep against the REAL `ps`.
 * Its `kill` seam forwards the signal only for the pids this file spawned and
 * merely RECORDS anything else the sweep matched: the sweep is machine-wide by
 * design, and a test run is not the place to exercise that half.
