/**
 * @omega.js/analytics — the ONE analytics consumption surface.
 *
 * Client code and backend code alike call `analytics.event('<canonical>', params)`
 * ([#328](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/328) §Architecture).
 * What differs underneath — page globals on a browser, the Measurement
 * Protocol and the conversion APIs on a server — is the TRANSPORT, injected by
 * the host and invisible to callers.
 *
 * One fire walks three steps per provider:
 *   1. consent — a blocked category's providers never even resolve
 *   2. adapter — the catalog mapping, or null when the provider has none
 *   3. transport — the host's seam; a missing global is a silent no-op (#306)
 *
 * In development the whole walk prints as ONE line per fire, which is the job
 * `setupTrackingInterceptors()` did in web core's `libs/dev.js` (they retired
 * with the rewire).
 *
 * Environment is INJECTED, never sniffed — the same seam the rest of the
 * ecosystem uses (`@omega.js/client`'s `config.environment === 'development'`).
 * The default is 'production': an unconfigured runtime must never throw an
 * event-name error at a visitor.
