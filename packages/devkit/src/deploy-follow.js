/**
 * deploy-follow: follow a dispatched GitHub Actions run to its verdict
 * ([#873](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/873)).
 *
 * A dispatch used to end at the runs page URL: the verb printed a link and
 * exited 0 while the run it had just started went red a few minutes later. So
 * every dispatched deploy follows its run instead, through this ONE follower
 * (it was desktop's alone, inside `omega release`, on `@octokit/rest`): the run
 * and its jobs are polled, each job's log is streamed with its name in front,
 * and the verb's exit code is the run's conclusion.
 *
 * Why poll instead of stream? GitHub Actions exposes no live stdout: a job's
 * log is fetchable only as each STEP closes, so "streaming" is a polite fiction
 * where every tick re-fetches each job's log and prints the bytes it has not
 * printed yet.
 *
 * A poll failure is an expected external condition, never a verdict: a connect
 * timeout on one tick used to mark a deploy failed on the laptop and stop a
 * brand fan-out while the run went green. MAX_TRANSIENT_POLLS failures IN A ROW
 * rethrow; anything short of that waits and polls again.
 *
 * Everything prints through the caller's logger, so the lines carry that verb's
 * tag and land in whatever file the verb teed (`logs/deploy.log`:
 * [docs/shared/logging.md](../../../docs/shared/logging.md)).
