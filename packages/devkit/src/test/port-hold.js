/**
 * Classic-port holding: how an e2e lane owns a whole stack without ever
 * disturbing the one a developer has running.
 *
 * The N7 allocator starts from the CLASSIC defaults and bumps past anything
 * taken, so a lane that HOLDS every classic port forces its children onto
 * fresh numbers while a live `omega dev` keeps serving. A busy classic port
 * is somebody else's stack: the hold declines it and the allocator bumps.
 * "Held" means both LOOPBACK addresses, 127.0.0.1 and ::1, after the
 * allocator's own probe has answered "no foreign listener". Never the bare
 * wildcard: on Linux it collides with the hold's own loopback bind.
