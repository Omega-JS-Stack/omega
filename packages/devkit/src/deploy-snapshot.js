/**
 * deploy-snapshot: push a brand folder to its repo as a MIRROR, then wait for
 * GitHub to see the workflow there
 * ([#872](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/872)).
 *
 * A workflow only ever runs from code GitHub already has. A brand that is not
 * its own repo's toplevel (a brand inside this monorepo) and a brand carrying
 * `file:` links (whose packed tarballs must never enter its real history) both
 * hit the same wall: there is nothing to dispatch against. So the deploy pushes
 * what it has, as it is (Ian, 2026-09-10: "we just push the contents of the
 * repository whenever we need to use it"), and dispatches that.
 *
 * The commit is built OUT OF THE WAY: a temporary index, no branch, no stash,
 * no checkout, nothing a `git status` or a `git branch` can see, and the working
 * tree the developer is looking at is never touched. Its ROOT is the BRAND
 * FOLDER, never the enclosing repo's, so the mirror is a brand checkout and not
 * a copy of whatever tree the brand happens to live in, and it is PARENTLESS:
 * a mirror carries no history, which is also what keeps a public brand repo
 * from receiving the private tree it was cut from. That promise is the whole
 * module's ([#915](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/915)): the
 * sync that used to run first, committing and pushing the developer's own
 * branch with `git add -A`, is gone, and nothing here commits anything a
 * developer did not.
 *
 * ONE write ever reaches a repo's DEFAULT branch, and it is `pushWorkflowFiles`
 * below: GitHub registers a workflow from the default branch (the listing and
 * the dispatch both read the file from there, and the `ref` only picks the
 * checkout the run uses), so the composed `.github/workflows/*.yml` have to BE
 * there for the deploy branch to be buildable at all. It compares bytes first
 * and pushes only what is missing or changed, through the git data API, so no
 * working tree, index or local branch is involved in that either.
 *
 * What rides is what the brand's own ignore rules allow: tracked files plus
 * untracked-not-ignored ones, which is exactly how the staged `omega_modules/`
 * tarballs and the regenerated lockfile reach the runner.
 *
 * The COMPANY layer rides the same way, resolved here and generated as one file
 * ([#677](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/677)): the machine that
 * dispatches has the machine registry and the company tree, and the runner has
 * neither, so what the runner gets is the ANSWER. No runner ever reads
 * `company/`. The env half needs nothing: the deploy precheck publishes the COMPOSED
 * target env (company then brand then target), so the company's `.env` values
 * are already repo secrets by the time a workflow runs.
 *
 * The token travels in the environment (`http.extraheader` through
 * GIT_CONFIG_*), never in argv, where every `ps` on the machine would read it.
 * That delivery, and the scrub a failure is rethrown through, are
 * `@omega.js/devkit/git-auth`'s: the web deploy's gh-pages push is the other
 * lane pushing to a repo its checkout is not authenticated for, and one
 * spelling of the rule is what keeps a token out of BOTH
 * ([#883](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/883)).

/**
 * Wait for a ref to RESOLVE to the sha this run just pushed
 * ([#902](https://github.com/Omega-JS-Stack/omega/issues/902)).
 *
 * A force-push returns as soon as GitHub accepts it, but GitHub resolves the
 * branch on its own side: a dispatch sent in the same second can still resolve
 * `main` to the PREVIOUS commit, and the run then builds a tree this deploy
 * never pushed, green, with nothing in its log saying so. So the push is
 * followed by a bounded wait on the ref itself, exactly as the workflow
 * listing is waited for above.
 *
 * @param {object} options - Options.
 * @param {string} options.owner - The repo's owner.
 * @param {string} options.repo - The repo's bare name.
 * @param {string} options.ref - The branch the snapshot went to.
 * @param {string} options.sha - The sha the push returned.
 * @param {string} options.token - The GitHub token.
 * @param {Function} [options.fetchFn] - Injectable fetch (tests).
 * @param {number} [options.attempts] - The poll budget.
 * @param {number} [options.delayMs] - The wait between polls.
 * @param {object} [options.logger] - Logger with `log` (silent when omitted).
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves once the ref carries the pushed sha.
 * @throws {Error} When the budget runs out on another sha.
