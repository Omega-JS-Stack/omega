/**
 * The emulator teardown contract (#440) — the reason test/lib/emulator.js
 * exists at all.
 *
 * A lane's emulator is a process TREE, and a signal aimed at the leader's pid
 * alone does not reach the rest of it. Whatever is left holds the write end of
 * the lane's pipes: the lane goes green, the readable never ends, and node
 * sits there instead of exiting (one manager run hung ~25 minutes at teardown).
 *
 * None of that is provable against the real firebase CLI in a unit lane — it
 * needs a JVM and half a minute — so the stub here wears the SHAPE the
 * teardown must survive: a detached group whose child inherits the pipes and
 * outlives a leader-only signal. The proof is the symptom itself: a node
 * process that boots one, tears it down with the helper, and EXITS.
