/**
 * Manager registry — SERVICE_ORDER, per-service OPERATIONS (from operations.js), and the manager
 * defaults layer. This is omega-manager's config.js reborn for the brand-
 * monorepo world: the brand's config/omega.json5 is the single home of every
 * provisioned fact (no .brands/ mirror), secrets live in the brand .env, and
 * per-run transients in .omega/runs/{ts}.json.
 *
 * omega-manager's full provisioning order is ported — every service in
 *
 *   github → cloudflare → domain → firebase → recaptcha → analytics →
 *   search-console → adsense → sendgrid → beehiiv → payment → slapform →
 *   chatsy → replyify → server → assets → certificates → seo → disperse →
 *   update → account → migrations → bookmark → testing
 *
 * now runs here, plus the workspace service (brand structure/config
 * health) the monorepo world added. disperse is registered with NO operations
 * (#891): the config dispersal dissolved into the omega.json5 hierarchy, the
 * .env composition into the delivery step every verb runs (#678), and the
 * signing artifacts are read in place from the signing tree. bookmark +
 * the beehiiv segment automation talk to the OMEGA Companion extension,
 * which is the OMEGA brand's own extension target now and no longer a tree
 * inside this package (#927). Onboarding is the
 * `onboard` wizard; a company is a LAYER a brand names, never a mode (#677).
 *
 * Provider-named services renamed to their config ROLE key (cp134, Ian:
 * "rename services so they match the config key"): firebase→cloud,
 * sendgrid→campaigns, beehiiv→newsletter, sentry→monitoring; the last eight
 * followed in #418: github→repo, cloudflare→edge, recaptcha→captcha,
 * search-console→search, adsense→advertising, slapform→forms, chatsy→chat,
 * replyify→email. Provider STRINGS and provider KEYS in config
 * (cloud.provider: 'firebase', edge.providers.cloudflare,
 * inbound.chat.providers.chatsy, …) are unchanged — the service is the role,
 * the provider is a value.

// DEFAULT SETTINGS - The manager defaults layer under every brand config
// =============================================================================

// Only what a schema `default:` cannot carry (docs/shared/config.md): null or
// empty placeholders a service writes back or an owner fills, settings under a
// `providers.<vendor>` key whose presence picks that vendor, and the case-3
// `devlog.enabled`. The exported DEFAULTS is the schema's defaults plus this.
const MANAGER_DEFAULTS = {
  // Domain registrar and email: two roles, one providers block each, the KEY
  // under `providers` picking the vendor. No entry: a terminal walk asks, a
  // headless one skips. `false` at `email.providers` or `email.forwarding` means none.

      forwarding: [], // [{ from: 'support' | '*', to: 'inbox@example.com' }] — role-level, provider-agnostic
    },
  },

  // Cloud settings — ONE home (#23): the provisioning fields the manager owns
  // sit beside `cloud.provider`/`cloud.config` (the target config @omega.js/config
  // declares), including the platform-level org + billing account the project
  // ensures consume. Auth: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID + GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET in the
  // brand .env. projectId has no default and lives ONLY at cloud.config.projectId
  // — interactive runs offer the project selection/creation flow and land it
  // there; non-interactive runs skip until it's set. Company values
  // omega-manager hardcoded (googlegroup support email, the company org and
  // billing account) are config now — they land in company/brand config.

  // Analytics providers. Google auth: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID + GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
  // in the brand .env (analytics.edit scope, tokens cached separately from
  // firebase's). propertyId is required config — interactive runs offer the
  // account + property selection/creation flow and land both ids here
  // (comment-preserving writeback). Meta/TikTok pixel IDs are public config
  // too — the service CREATES the pixel on the platform's accountId and lands
  // its id here (#417); Meta needs neither filled in, since an interactive run
  // pastes the token in and discovers the ad account from it (a provider set
  // to `false` opts out of all of it). Their access tokens live in the brand
  // .env (META_ACCESS_TOKEN / TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN — the names @omega.js/backend

  // Search Console (submitSitemap + sitemapPaths: schema defaults) needs no

  // subdomain; DNS TXT verification writes through Cloudflare. Auth: the same
  // GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID + GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as firebase/analytics (own token
  // cache — webmasters + siteverification scopes). omega-manager also carried
  // a `subdomains: []` key here that nothing ever read — dropped.

  // AdSense: deliberately NO defaults entry (wave-5 F10). The service gates on
  // the PRESENCE of `advertising.providers.adsense` in the merged
  // config — seeding it here would defeat that gate (defaults merge under
  // every brand), and the account-selection flow would land a shared account
  // into brands that never opted in. A brand (or the company layer) authors
  // the provider entry — even empty — to opt in; `client` (ca-pub-…) comes
  // from config or the interactive selection flow.

  // Marketing — TWO roles, one providers block each (#425). campaigns = email
  // marketing (the campaigns service); newsletter = the newsletter (the
  // newsletter service). The vendor is a KEY under `providers`; `enabled`
  // stays role-level, and so does `newsletter.content` (it configures
  // @omega.js/backend's generator, not Beehiiv). listId/publicationId are
  // resolved by the services and written back under their provider
  // (comment-preserving writeback), with a state mirror as the resolution
  // cache. Auth: SENDGRID_API_KEY / BEEHIIV_API_KEY in the brand .env
  // (+ OMEGA_WEBHOOK_KEY for the webhook operations).
