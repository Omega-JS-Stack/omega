/**
 * Ensure the brand's package.json scripts convention — the root AND each
 * framework target's (npm scripts put node_modules/.bin on PATH, so plain
 * `omega` resolves there). Script VALUES only — no other key or consumer
 * content is ever touched. Idempotent: a converged file rewrites nothing.
 *
 * Root: `deploy: 'omega deploy'` guaranteed plus the start/manage migration
 * (package-scripts.js). Targets: every script the framework writes (the verb
 * table's `omega <verb>` scripts, its manifest's `projectScripts` merged over
 * them) is FRAMEWORK-owned and is rewritten to the default here, exactly as
 * that framework's ensureTarget does on every verb run:
 * one policy, two writers, so a consumer customizes behavior through hook
 * points and never by editing a standard script. The walk running it at all
 * is the onboard→dev cycle break (#675): the dev fan-out reaches those verbs
 * THROUGH these scripts, so a freshly scaffolded target needs them before any
 * verb has ever run. Keys the consumer added are never touched.
 *
 * The exceptions: a custom TARGET maps to no framework at all (#603), so it
 * is skipped whole; a custom-server backend is skipped PER KEY: the
 * scripts running a verb its mode refuses are the brand's own, named by the
 * framework's scaffold entry (`CUSTOM_OWNED_SCRIPTS`).
