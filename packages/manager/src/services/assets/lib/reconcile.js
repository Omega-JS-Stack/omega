/**
 * Assets reconcile (#636) — every file under `.omega/assets/` derives from the
 * brand's sources and config, so the walk that writes them also DELETES the
 * ones those sources no longer derive. Dropping `assets/logo/wordmark.svg` is
 * a real removal: the wordmark's variants and ladders go with it, not on the
 * next hand-deletion of the cache.
 *
 * Deleting is safe HERE and only here: `.omega/assets/` is the machine-owned,
 * gitignored cache the reset already clears (lib/reset.js), and every file in
 * it is regenerable from the brand's committed sources. The brand's own
 * collateral (`assets/logo/*.svg`, `assets/templates/*.psd`) is a SOURCE and
 * is never touched.
 *
 * Two locks keep it honest: the derived set comes from the SAME names the
 * writers generate (lib/derived.js), and the diff runs only inside the
 * operations' own output dirs — a file the assets service never writes into
 * cannot be reached from here.
