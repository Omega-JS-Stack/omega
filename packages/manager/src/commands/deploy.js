/**
 * `omega deploy` at a brand root — D13's brand layer: fan the DELIBERATE
 * publish out over the brand's targets, each in its own framework's hands
 * (each target's own `omega deploy` verb — web sync/dispatch or direct lane,
 * backend `firebase deploy`, desktop release, extension publish; the full
 * per-target contract is docs/shared/deploys.md).
 *
 *   omega deploy                       → every target, backend first
 *   omega deploy --target=backend      → one target (target key or dir name)
 *   omega deploy --target=web,backend  → explicit set
 *   omega deploy --dry-run             → forwarded — each target prints its plan
 *
 * ORDER (#901): the DELIVERY lane first (#678), the same `BOOT_SERVICES` walk
 * an `omega dev` boot runs, so config, assets and certs reach the targets
 * before anything publishes them; then every selected target's own scaffold,
 * called in-process (the workflows it composes have to exist before the
 * snapshot carries them); then the run's ONE delivery; then
 * BACKEND alone; then web, desktop, extension and any custom target
 * CONCURRENTLY. Backend is the only dependency anything has (the site points at
 * its API), and the rest depend on nothing, so they publish together. Every
 * flag but --target= forwards verbatim to each target's framework deploy
 * (--dry-run, --direct, --platforms, …). A failing BACKEND stops the
 * run before the group unless --continue-on-error; inside the group every
 * target runs to completion and the run then exits 1 naming the failed ones. A
 * --target= token matching nothing is an error, never a deploy-everything
 * fallback, and deploys stay deliberate: nothing invokes this command but the
 * human-typed verb (D13).
 *
 * ONE DELIVERY per run (#901): a lane's delivery used to run once per TARGET,
 * which is what kept the targets in single file. It runs HERE now, once: the
 * one lane (#915) force-pushes the brand folder to `omega-deploy` and every
 * target verb is handed `--snapshot=<sha>` so it dispatches against that very
 * commit instead of overwriting it under its siblings.
